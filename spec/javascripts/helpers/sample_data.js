        "body":"<p>A quick burst of 9 links for you to chew over, as picked by the Technology team</p><h2><a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120419/verizon-half-of-our-first-quarter-smartphone-sales-were-iphones/\">Verizon: Half of our first-quarter smartphone sales were iPhones &gt;&gt; AllThingsD</a></h2><blockquote><p>Apple's iPhone continues to sell well at Verizon, though not quite as well as last quarter. Reporting first-quarter earnings largely in line with expectations this morning, Verizon said it sold 6.3m smartphones. Of those, 3.2m were iPhones.</p></blockquote><p> This is quite surprising, isn't it? What would be really useful would be knowing what proportion of smartphone sales go to new customers, and what proportion are purchases by existing smartphone users (and of what platform). Also: Verizon sold 2.1m LTE-enabled smartphones, 1m less than the still-3G iPhone.</p><h2><a href=\"http://torrentfreak.com/isps-have-to-identify-alleged-pirates-eu-court-rules-120419/\">ISPs Have to Identify Alleged Pirates, EU Court Rules &gt;&gt; TorrentFreak</a></h2><blockquote><p>A dispute over whether a Swedish ISP can be forced to hand over the details of one its subscribers to an anti-piracy group has just received its long-awaited ruling from the Europe's highest court. A few moments ago the European Court of Justice announced that there are no EU barriers which prevent the ISP handing over its customers' private details to copyright holders.</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/nunos/archive/2012/04/19/my-comments-on-windows-phone.aspx\">My comments on Windows Phone - Life as a Developer Evangelist &gt;&gt; MSDN Blogs</a></h2><p>Nuno Silva: </p><blockquote><p>I recently participated in an interview with the Portuguese website Zwame, where I made some comments on the future of Windows Phone that created confusion. Rumors are swirling, so I feel the need to clarify my statements.</p><p> The point I was attempting to make was simply that existing Windows Phone applications will run on the next version of Windows Phone. This is the same guidance that Microsoft shared late last year.</p><p> I mistakenly confused app compatibility with phone updateability, which caused the rumors we saw yesterday.  I did not intend to give the impression I was offering new guidance on any products under development or their upgradeability.</p></blockquote><p> Microsoft is being cagey about whether current phones running Windows Phone 7 or Windows Phone 7.5 will be able to run Windows Phone 8 when it comes out later this year. Either it hasn't decided or it doesn't want to break the bad news. More important question: does it matter?</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.securelist.com/en/analysis/204792227/The_anatomy_of_Flashfake_Part_1\">The anatomy of Flashfake. Part 1 &gt;&gt; Securelist</a></h2><p>How all those Macs got infected: </p><blockquote><p>The partner program was based on script redirects from huge numbers of legitimate websites all over the world. Around the end of February/early March 2012, tens of thousands of sites powered by WordPress were compromised. How this happened is unclear. The main theories are that bloggers were using vulnerable versions of WordPress or they had installed the ToolsPack plugin. Websense put the number of affected sites at 30,000 , while other companies say the figure could be as high as 100,000. Approximately 85% of the compromised blogs are located in the US.</p><p> Code was injected into the main pages when the blogs were hacked. As a result, when any of the compromised sites were visited, a partner program TDS was contacted. Depending on the operating system and browser version, the browser then performed a hidden redirect to sites in the rr.nu domain zone that had the appropriate set of exploits installed on them to carry out an infection.</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"http://9to5mac.com/2012/04/19/apple-marketing-svp-phil-schiller-dumps-instagram-over-expansion-to-android/\">Apple marketing SVP Phil Schiller dumps Instagram over expansion to Android &gt;&gt; 9to5Mac</a></h2><blockquote><p>Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey is not the only photo-loving business executive upset by Instagram in recent weeks. While Dorsey stopped posting photos from his Instagram after Facebook reportedly beat his Twitter to an acquisition of Instagram, Apple Senior Vice President quit his Instagram for another reason: Android.</p></blockquote><p> And a week or two later they sold for a billion dollars. Some shark. Some jump.</p><h2><a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/04/18/who-is-tim-lindholm-googles-ceo-is-wondering-that-too/\">Who Is Tim Lindholm? Google's CEO is wondering that too &gt;&gt; WSJ Digits Blog</a></h2><blockquote><p>Google has fought to keep the email out of the trial taking place now in San Francisco, to no avail. During his testimony earlier this week, Mr. Page said he couldn't recall the email, or providing such directions to Mr. Lindholm, or even for that matter the identity of Mr. Lindholm.</p><p> So, who is Tim Lindholm?</p></blockquote><p> Likely to be called this week.</p><h2><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2012/04/19/opinion/keen-breivik-internet/index.html\">Does the internet breed killers? &gt;&gt; CNN.com</a></h2><p>Terrible headline on a more interesting piece by Andrew Keen (described as a \"professional sceptic\". They never mentioned that at the careers office.) The kernel of this argument is this: </p><blockquote><p>Narcissism, of course, wasn't invented by the Internet and it would be absurd to establish a causal connection between self-love and mass murder. That said, however, today's digital media culture - which shatters the 20th century mass audience into billions of 21st century authors and enables them all to broadcast their most intimate thoughts to the world - seems to be making narcissism the default mode of contemporary existence.</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2012/apr/19/copyright-freedom-speech\">Supporting copyright is not the same as opposing freedom of speech &gt;&gt; guardian.co.uk</a></h2><p>(Musician) Helienne Lindvall: </p><blockquote><p>I was told to prepare a five-minute speech, so apart from speaking of the reality musicians are facing, I spent days reading the actual [ACTA] agreement, different points of views on it, as well as looking into the different issues it deals with, to make sure I knew what was being discussed. I'd heard from the Pirate Party as well as some other action groups that it would impede freedom of speech so naturally I was concerned - after all, musicians rely on freedom of expression, as do journalists. I was surprised to find that Acta would do nothing of the sort. In fact, it wouldn't change any existent laws in the EU.</p><p> It soon became clear that my preparations were in vain.</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/04/oracle-v-google-trial-evidence-of.html\">Oracle v. Google trial &gt;&gt; FOSS Patents</a></h2><p>Amidst his analysis of the first days of the Oracle-Google trial, Florian Müller adds: </p><blockquote><p>As an independent analyst and blogger, I will express only my own opinions, which cannot be attributed to any one of my diversity of clients. I often say things none of them would agree with. That said, as a believer in transparency I would like to inform you that Oracle has very recently become a consulting client of mine. We intend to work together for the long haul on mostly competition-related topics including, for one example, FRAND licensing terms.</p><p> We've known each other ever since I vocally opposed Oracle's acquisition of Sun Microsystems (not because of Java), but that's history as I fully respect the European Commission's clearance decision and the subsequent closing of the deal.</p></blockquote><p> This will make him even more of a hate figure in Groklaw's comment threads, if that is possible. (People there won't admit to having read his blog, won't link to it, but denounce everything he does.) Müller has reckoned from the start that Google has a copyright infringement case to answer. Groklaw reckons Larry Ellison has a tail and smells of sulphur, and that Google walks on water and smells of roses. Either way, it's up to the jury now.</p><p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.

Of course we can't guarantee security. I'd be a fool to sit here and say that. Is it possible there might be an incursion on the track? Of course there is. It's an open event.

In a statement it said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Chief of public security, Major-General Tariq Al Hassan, said that as part of the police duty to maintain security and stability in Bahrain and enforce the law, a number of rioters and vandals had been  arrested for taking part in illegal rallies and gatherings, hindering public and private interests by blocking roads and endangering people's lives by attacking them as well as policemen with Molotov cocktails, iron rods and stones ...</p><p>The chief of public security said that such acts of vandalism did not come under the definition of freedom of expression protected by the law. Instead, they are considered acts causing chaos which are against civilised behaviour and endanger civil peace. He affirmed that maintaining security and peace among the public and ensuring their safety as well as the safety of public and private property were the top priorities for security men and any violation was tackled by police with zero tolerance. Any activities which violate the law are tackled firmly according to legal regulations and the authority of police, he said.</p></blockquote><p>Later today the trial of 20 medics targeted by the government after they treated injured protesters is due to resume.

I spoke with several ministers about the need to tighten sanctions, tighten pressure on the regime, on those who support the regime. And we also are going to continue pressing for a political solution, which remains the goal of Kofi Annan's plan and the understandable goal of anyone who wants to see a peaceful transition occur in Syria.</p></blockquote><p>On the UN monitors she said: </p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>It is, obviously, quite concerning that while we are deploying these monitors pursuant to a security council resolution that confirms our commitment to Kofi Annan's six-point plan, the guns of the Assad regime are once again firing in Homs, Idlib, and elsewhere, and Syrians continue to die. So we are certainly cognizant of the very challenging road ahead.

        "headline":"US drone strikes in Yemen crucial to prevent terrorist threat, Panetta says",
        "body":"<p>US defence secretary Leon Panetta defended the use of drones to kill terror suspects on Thursday amid reports that the CIA is seeking permission to expand strikes in Yemen, a move that renewed debate about the legality of the strategy.</p><p>Panetta told a congressional hearing that such drone strikes were precise, and targeted only terrorists planning attacks on the US.  </p><p>But an international legal expert countered that such strikes were unlawful, executing suspects without a trial. Such a strategy was questionable enough when employed in Afghanistan but was doubly so in Yemen, given that the US is not at war there, she said.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/cia-seeks-new-authority-to-expand-yemen-drone-campaign/2012/04/18/gIQAsaumRT_story.html\">The Washington Post reported on Thursday</a> that the CIA was seeking a wider definition of targets in Yemen so it can launch drones against individuals engaged in behaviour deemed suspicious, such as unloading explosives or gathering at suspected al-Qaida compounds. The White House has not yet made a decision. </p><p>The US has been using drones against suspected militants since 2002 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and around the Horn of Africa. The use of drones in Yemen has been increasing, with Washington fearful about the threat posed to the Yemeni government from insurgents.  </p><p>There have been about eight drone strikes in Yemen this year, with innocent civilians amoung the casualties. Insurgents from a group allegedly linked to al-Qaida claimed three of its members were killed by a drone on Monday. The Yemeni government claims it was a rocket. </p><p>Panetta, asked about the Post report during a hearing of the House armed services committee, said the drones were aimed only at people in Yemen posing a threat to the US.</p><p>\"Our target there represents those terrorists, or those al-Qaida terrorists that involve a threat to this country, and there are very specific targets,\" Panetta said. \"This is not broad-based. We are not becoming part of any kind of civil war disputes in that country. We are very precise, and very targeted and will remain pursuant to those operations.\" </p><p>The intention was to confine such attacks only to those al-Qaida terrorists planning attacks on the US. \"No more, no less,\" Panetta said.</p><p>The chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, General Martin Dempsey, said that drones were not the only tactic being used in Yemen. Counter-terrorism training was being given to Yemeni special forces.</p><p>Dempsey said: \"It's important not to see this as we are only doing one thing and not the other.\"</p><p>But Mary Ellen O'Connell, an international law specialist at Notre Dame university, challenged the legality of the strikes. She expressed unease with what she described as a return to the ugly strategy used by the US in the Vietnam war and in Central America.</p><p>O'Connell, who is also vice-president of the American Society of International Law and who has testified to Congress on legal issues, said of the proposed expansion in Yemen: \"In other words, the CIA is seeking to escalate an already unlawful campaign of targeted killing at the very time Yemen needs support building the rule of law and ending violence and military conflict. The last time the CIA had this much freedom to kill was in Vietnam. It killed 25,000 people, and the US lost the war.\"</p><p>She said that the Obama administration had decided that detaining people was causing political difficulties so they are just killing them instead, and governments round the world are quiescent. She noted that Obama is a law professor and expressed surprise that this should be happening on his watch.</p><p>The sensitivities around American strikes in Yemen were illustrated by US embassy cables from 2009, which were made public on WikiLeaks. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/03/wikileaks-yemen-us-attack-al-qaida\">They detailed how US attacks were carried out covertly</a> and were presented as the work of the Yemeni government to prevent outraging local and regional opinion.</p><p>In August last year, the former US director of national intelligence, retired admiral Dennis Blair, wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times arguing that while drones had served a useful purpose they had become counterproductive, increasing hatred of America in Pakistan.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=US+foreign+policy&k=United+States&k=US+military&k=Yemen&k=CIA&k=World+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=US+drone+strikes+in+Yemen+crucial+to+prevent+terrorist+threat%2C+Panetta+says+Article+1733903&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=US+foreign+policy%2CUS+news%2CUS+military+%28News%29%2CYemen+%28News%29%2CCIA%2CWorld+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-19&c8=1733903&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/19/us-drone-strikes-yemen-panetta|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|97b81657046b4cfdbb5036071bdb23136ad307b2 -->",

        "headline":"Black fireman says he was abused and Tasered by Met",
        "body":"<p>Scotland Yard is facing a new case of alleged police racism after a black firefighter who tried to assist officers while off duty claimed he was targeted because of his skin colour, abused, assaulted and shot with a stun gun.</p><p>The complaint lodged by Edric Kennedy-Macfoy, 28, from north London, is the 10th case involving alleged racism known to have been referred to the official police watchdog in the last three weeks.</p><p>Kennedy-Macfoy was driving through Harrow around 3.30am on 4 September when he saw a young man hurl a rock at a police van. After noting a description of the young man, Kennedy-Macfoy, who also trained as a police constable, flagged down the van driver and approached a line of officers to pass the information on.</p><p>He said he was horrified at their response, which he alleges included officers behaving like \"wild animals\": swearing at him, dragging him from his car, subjecting him to a \"violent\" attack and eventually shooting him with a stun gun.</p><p>Kennedy-Macfoy was found not guilty in February of obstructing police. During a two-day trial at Brent magistrates court, Inspector David Bergum, who was present on the night, said his officers were in a \"stressful\" situation and had been dealing with a group of partygoers who had been throwing missiles at them.</p><p>He said of Kennedy-Macfoy: \"I couldn't say he was anything to do with the party. The party was all black. He was black. He had driven through the cordon. I had to do a quick risk assessment.\"</p><p>Details of the inspector's comments in court were sent to the Metropolitan police's complaints department last week. The force confirmed four days later that it would refer the case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).</p><p>There are now <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/16/met-police-cases-alleged-racism\" title=\"\">12 cases</a> of alleged racism under investigation: six are being investigated internally at the Met, while the other five are being handled by the IPCC.</p><p>They include the case of Met police constable Alex MacFarlane, who discovered on Wednesday that he is to face criminal charges over a mobile phone recording which allegedly captured him racially abusing a black suspect.</p><p>Kennedy-Macfoy's complaint, which is against six police officers, brings the total number of Met officers currently under investigation for alleged racism to 26.</p><p>The firefighter, who left the Hendon police training academy after his mother became ill with cancer in 2005, said he hoped his complaint would make police \"think twice\" before stereotyping black men.</p><p>Although Kennedy-Macfoy has worked alongside police officers \"almost every day\" for six years, and has a number of close friends in the police, he said he had struggled to return to work as a firefighter since the experience.</p><p>On the night he was shot with the stun gun, he was wearing a three-piece pinstriped suit and driving a white Audi when he encountered a police roadblock and assumed there had been a road traffic accident.</p><p>In fact the police were dealing with the aftermath of a party that had been closed down, and officers had been subject to a hail of bottles and bricks. Kennedy-Macfoy had stopped behind a police van when he saw a young man pick up a rock.</p><p>\"He launched it at this police van window and I was actually scared for whoever was in the police van,\" he said. \"I knew it was occupied because the reverse lights kept on coming on and off.\"</p><p>The firefighter noted the man who had thrown the rock was black, wearing blue jeans, a black top and holding a red garment. When the van driver turned the vehicle, he tried to flag him down to pass on the description. According to Kennedy-Macfoy's complaint, the van driver did not let him speak, shouting: \"Fuck off you prick.\"</p><p>When the van moved away, Kennedy-Macfoy drove to a cordon of police officers with shields further along the road. He said he pulled up by the officers for three reasons: to relay the description of the young man who had thrown the rock, request the badge number of the van driver who he alleged swore at him, so he could complain, and to ask for the quickest route home.</p><p>However, before he was able to convey the information, Kennedy-Macfoy alleges a number of officers began \"hurling abuse\" at him, charging at his car and grabbing him \"viciously\" through the windows.</p><p>He says he was dragged from the car and in the ensuing melee the officers repeatedly encircled him and shouted profanities. He said he replied calmly and showed his palms to the officers, telling them: \"Listen guys, I haven't done anything wrong. I'm a firefighter \u2013 I work with you lot and I just want to explain something. I've showed no aggression toward any of you.\"</p><p>The fireman said he recalled police telling people who were filming the scene with their mobile phones: \"Turn those fucking cameras off.\" He said the stun gun was discharged when he was walking backwards with his hands in the air.</p><p>In court, the police officer who discharged the weapon conceded he did not warn Kennedy-Macfoy he was about to be shot \u2013 an apparent contravention of Home Office guidelines.</p><p>Kennedy-Macfoy's complaint against police was submitted shortly after the attack. He alleged he was shot without warning and said he believed he had been targeted because of his race.</p><p>The Met should automatically refer all complaints involving the use of their Taser stun guns to the IPCC. However in Kennedy-Macfoy's case, the force decided to deal with the complaint internally for seven months. On Wednesday, following inquiries from the Guardian, and a letter from Kennedy-Macfoy's lawyers which drew attention to the evidence officers gave in court about race, the Met decided it would refer the case to the IPCC.</p><p>The Met said in a statement that it had not automatically referred the case to the IPCC due to \"oversight\". It added: \"Such allegations are taken extremely seriously and the investigation will explore all the circumstances and evidence \u2026 As a Taser was discharged this case is a mandatory referral to the IPCC.\" The IPCC confirmed it had received the referral and was \"assessing\" the complaint.</p><p>Kennedy-Macfoy said he might not have pursued his case if police had not sought to prosecute him \u2013 a move he alleges required them to \"concoct false accounts of events\" to justify their actions.</p><p>\"People make mistakes; you've got good cops and bad cops,\" he said. \"People act differently under pressure. If at that point they had just said: 'Mate, so sorry \u2013 we have been dealing with this party and got it totally wrong,' I really wouldn't have pursued anything. I still would have been pissed off, but I would have accepted their apology and their acknowledgement that they had messed up.\"</p><p>If the attempt to prosecute Kennedy-Macfoy had succeeded he would have faced losing his job. He was acquitted on 7 February, despite the evidence against him given by several police officers.</p><p>Kennedy-Macfoy's solicitor, Shamik Dutta, of Bhatt Murphy solicitors, voiced concerns at his client's allegations, saying: \"The question many people are bound to ask is why an off-duty firefighter, wearing a pinstriped suit and offering assistance to the police, should have been dragged from his car, shot with a Taser, locked up for many hours and then prosecuted for an offence he did not commit by the very officers he was trying to help.</p><p>\"Our client now expects a comprehensive investigation which examines what role his race has had in the horrific events he has been forced to suffer.\"</p><p>Kennedy-Macfoy said this was not his first experience of discrimination at the hands of police: \"I always get stopped by the police and it's always the same. [Police say:] 'Oh, you know, loads of these cars get stolen, so we just need to check you are who you say you are, blah blah blah.' And I know it is because I'm black. My friend Vince, he's a fireman \u2013 he borrows my car sometimes and it's a running joke at the fire station \u2013 he's never been stopped.\"</p><p>Brian Paddick, a former senior officer at Scotland Yard, said on Thursday he would appoint an independent commissioner for standards to help tackle \"endemic\" racism within the Metropolitan police if he were elected London mayor in May.</p><p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 April 2012. The original article included an extraneous sentence about the IPCC referral.

        "body":"<p>US defence secretary Leon Panetta disclosed Thursday the Pentagon has plans in place for establishing humanitarian corridors in Syria, an idea publicly aired by French president Nicholas Sarkozy earlier in the day in Paris.</p><p>Panetta, giving evidence to the House armed services committee, said the plan for humanitarian corridors was under review in the Pentagon along with other military options for intervention aimed at helping the Syrian opposition and toppling Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.</p><p>The Pentagon remains reluctant to intervene militarily in Syria, saying that the conditions that existed for action in Libya do not yet apply in the country.</p><p>Panetta, citing the divided nature of opposition groups inside Syria, said: \"Outside military intervention could make a volatile situation worse\".</p><p>But Panetta, giving evidence alongside the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Martin Dempsey, said that all military options are under review in the Pentagon, ready to be implemented if Barack Obama gives the order.</p><p>Sarkozy \u2013 in an interview with Europe 1 radio ahead of the meeting of Friends of Syria group of nations that includes the US \u2013 called for humanitarian corridors.</p><p>A similar humanitarian corridor was established in Kurdish Iraq after the first Gulf War, providing a safe haven from Saddam Hussein's forces. A humanitarian corridor would also provide the Syrian opposition with a similar safe haven and a potential territorial base inside Syria.</p><p>Panetta, responding to a question about Sarkozy's proposal, said the humanitarian corridor was among options the US had looked at and a plan was in place. The US stood ready to do what the international community decided, he said.</p><p>Dempsey said there were various plans in place. \"Should we be called, our responsibility is clear \u2013 provide the secretary of the defence and the president with options,\" he said. \"This is what the nation expects of us.\"</p><p>He added: \"If asked to do so, we have the military capability.\"</p><p>The eventual option would depend on the outcome being sought: would it involve just stopping violence, or removing Assad? Dempsey would then have to look at the feasibility of any such option. Once the outcome was decided, he would then have to make clear to the president and Panetta the risk to the force involved.</p><p>Panetta said that at present there is no plan to put US boots on the ground or to act unilaterally.  </p><p>The Pentagon, under the then-secretary of defense Robert Gates, was extremely reluctant last year to become involved in Libya, and the eventual push came from secretary of state Hillary Clinton and from the White House.</p><p>While the US put no soldiers on the ground in Libya, it provided the air power that proved decisive in support of the Libyan opposition and the overthrow of the Libyan dictator, Muammar Gaddafi.</p><p>The US position towards Syria is evolving more slowly, but the Obama administration has come out in favour of regime change and more recently in providing nonlethal aid to the opposition groups.</p><p>Panetta stressed that diplomatic efforts were far from exhausted, including to get international monitors in place in Syria and a move to political reform. </p><p>The end game is to remove Assad. \"Anything that takes out the Assad regime is a step in the right direction,\" Panetta said.</p><p>Assad will continue to resist the diplomatic efforts but it is just a matter of time before he goes, he said.</p><p>\"From every angle the situation in Syria is enormously complex,\" he said. \"There is no silver bullet.\"</p><p>Dempsey expressed a tentative hope that the Syrian military might yet change. He said they may be fearful of repercussions for their violence against the civilian population. \"There is reason to believe the military could come to realise they are on a path to own destruction,\" he said.</p><p>Congress is divided over whether to intervene in Syria. Both the Republican chairman of the House armed services committee, Howard \"Buck\" McKeon, and Adam Smith, the highest-ranking Democrat on the committee, expressed reluctance to implement military action. John McCain, the highest-ranking Republican on the Senate armed services committee, is urging military intervention.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Syria&k=US+military&k=United+States&k=Bashar+al-Assad&k=US+national+security&k=Leon+Panetta\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=US+military+has+contingency+for+civilian+safe+havens+if+Syria+violence+escalates+Article+1733808&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Syria+%28News%29%2CUS+military+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CBashar+al-Assad%2CUS+national+security%2CLeon+Panetta%2CNicolas+Sarkozy+%28News%29%2CHuman+rights&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-19&c8=1733808&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/19/us-military-plan-syria-escalates|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|438f4a8722c805568bfa35b54fe3caef9ed5bb7a -->",

        "body":"<p>If you like being on the verge of tears \u2013 and who doesn't? \u2013 then the last in our Curzon on Demand series is tailored specifically for you.</p><p>Être et Avoir is a documentary by Nicolas Philibert about a primary school in rural Auvergne. Well, it is in the sense that that's where it's shot. It's also about the relationship between the school's sole teacher, Georges Lopez, and the kids for whom he cares. In the sense that those are the most commonly recurring scenes. But, really, and even though M Lopez appears to be nothing short of the ideal teacher (half pedagogue, half pastoral mentor), this film feels almost like it's floating above its situation, its real subject the beauty and complexity of the human being.</p><p>If that sounds a bit gushy, that's probably because I only stopped watching Être et Avoir a short while ago and I still feel a little choked up. But while this film, in certain circumstances, could be argued to be a tribute to vocational devotion or a paean to rural life, to me it appeared to be utterly disinterested in conveying a message; too fascinated by the glory in the quotidian to care about getting didactic.</p><p>Lingering on the face of a young boy (a \"little one\" called Johann) as he tries to process what's going on around him. Hanging at the end of a corridor as two more little ones try to act grownup and operate a photocopier, only to break the thing. (A repairman is later observed from the same spot.) The fields in spring and summer. The bravery of young Olivier as he attempts to discuss his father's cancer in a mature way, only for the effort, and the strength of feeling, to force him into tears. The collective act of maths homework performed around a rustic dinner table, as Olivier's friend and rival Julien struggles with his arithmetic. These moments and the emotions they inspire in the viewer are, I think, what this film is really about. A reminder of our common humanity.</p><p>That such a stream of tender intimacy could also be put to the use of venerating the French way of life was a happy coincidence that led to Être et Avoir (the only auxiliary, or \"helping\", verbs in French, you see) being a massive box-office hit in its own country. But any inferred moral was dispelled somewhat when success was followed by M Lopez bringing a lawsuit. He claimed he was owed money by the producers because of the extent to which his image was used to sell the film. He also said that he thought the documentary had been intended purely for educational purposes.</p><p>Anyone who watches the final, tearjerking shot as Lopez bids goodbye to his children will know that second claim could never have stood up. He went on to lose his case.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/film&k=Documentary&k=Film&k=Culture\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/film/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/film/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Curzon+on+Demand%3A+Etre+et+Avoir+Article+1733703&ch=Film&c2=148491&c4=Documentary+%28Film+genre%29%2CFilm%2CCulture&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Paul+MacInnes&c7=12-Apr-19&c8=1733703&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: film/filmblog/2012/apr/19/curzon-on-demand-etre-et-avoir|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|e57391ed63b61286bb9101d08c1bc95f1cf1f975 -->",

The decision had not been taken by a minister, she said.</p><p>Hain has vowed to defend free speech against what his publisher said was an arcane law banning criticism of judges, which had not been used in living memory.</p><p>Hain's remarks about Girvan caused controversy in Belfast when the book was published.</p><p>The lord chief justice, Sir Declan Morgan, described them as \"potentially an assault on the wider independence of the judiciary\".</p><p>Hain declined to back down and renewed his criticism, sparking the legal action by Larkin. The case is listed for review by the divisional court in Belfast on 24 April.</p><p>The attorney general's court submission claimed Hain's remarks \"constitute unwarranted abuse of a judge in his judicial capacity that undermines the administration of justice in this jurisdiction, and consequently constitute a contempt of court\".</p><p>The statement added that the book \"create[s] without justification a real risk that public confidence will be undermined in the judiciary\".</p><p>Hain said in a statement at the time of the attorney general's decision: \"I am astonished at this turn of events. I worked harder than anyone as secretary of state for Northern Ireland to uphold the rule of law and judicial independence and delivered the 2007 settlement which helped secure that.</p><p>\"If free speech and comment in a political memoir is to be suppressed then people will be entitled to ask: what system of justice prevails?\"</p><p>Judges such as Lord Justice Sedley have successfully prosecuted newspapers for libel and have sometimes complained that they are shackled combatants on issues of public controversy.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/politics&k=Peter+Hain&k=Northern+Ireland&k=Judiciary&k=Freedom+of+speech&k=Politics&k=UK+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Peter+Hain+backed+by+MPs+after+he+is+prosecuted+for+criticising+judge+Article+1733494&ch=Politics&c2=148491&c4=Peter+Hain%2CNorthern+Ireland+%28News%29%2CJudiciary%2CFreedom+of+speech+%28News%29%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CLaw%2CWorld+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Patrick+Wintour&c7=12-Apr-19&c8=1733494&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: politics/2012/apr/19/peter-hain-mps-prosecuted-judge|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|10994366911764a6647a97b0d9ebf70a65e0fb0a -->",

When the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2012/feb/29/worm-digital-war-mark-bowden-review\" title=\"\">Conficker</a> worm first appeared in 2008, it quickly spread at a rate that terrified observers, who had no idea what its criminal masters had in mind. Mac users have responded to the sounding of klaxons from internet security companies by pointing to the low level of infections thus far and the comparative rarity of Mac exploits in the wild. But no computer user can afford to be complacent about looking after their machine.</p><p>Protecting your computer from viruses is a bit like vaccinating your children: you do it not only for the good of your baby \u2013 whether your baby is a golden-haired moppet called Perdita or a shiny Core i7 MacBook Air \u2013 but also for the good of the community. Herd immunity protects the wider population from diseases; keeping your computer safe from nasties makes the internet safer. One of the keys to keeping your computer safe is making sure you religiously do the updates to your operating system. However, you can't rely on Microsoft or Apple pushing out updates in good time: Apple took three months to get around to patching the hole in Java that the Flashback trojan exploited. Malware is also spread via infected documents, and the latest Mac exploit, the Sabpab trojan, <a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2012/04/16/sabpab-trojan-mac-word/\" title=\"\">uses just this vector</a>. USB keys can contain infected documents, either deliberately or unknowingly boobytrapped \u2013 that's why your office won't let you use them at work. Porn sites and those offering dodgy software are often hosts for nasty stuff that sneaks on to your computer.</p><p>But by far the biggest risk to your computer is you. \"Users are very bad at making informed decisions about what is safe and what isn't safe behaviour,\" says Graham Cluley at internet security company Sophos. \"Cybercriminals are masters at social engineering and trick users into installing malware on their computers.\" Having a pretty MacBook doesn't make you smarter than Windows users. Cluley adds: \"The bad guys have seen the growth in popularity of Apple technology, recognise that the typical MacBook owner may be more likely to have more disposable income than a Windows user and importantly, are not running any antivirus at all. That makes Mac users a very soft target. I really don't believe that Mac users are any more immune to social engineering than their Windows cousins,\" he says.</p><p>I know. You love your Mac, and one of the reasons you love your Mac is because you don't have to bother your pretty little hipster head with mundane stuff like antimalware. But you do have to bother. Use tools such as the <a href=\"http://www.clamxav.com/\" title=\"\">free ClamXav tool</a>; Sophos also <a href=\"http://www.sophos.com/en-us/products/free-tools/sophos-antivirus-for-mac-home-edition.aspx\" title=\"\">produces a free tool for Macs</a>.  It's not just Windows users these days who have to worry about nasties on their machines.</p><p></p><p>\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/commentisfree\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Data+and+computer+security&k=Apple&k=Viruses&k=Malware&k=Computing&k=Technology\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mac+users+may+think+they%27re+safe+from+malware%2C+but+they%27re+not+%7C+Kate+Bevan+Article+1733001&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=148491&c4=Data+and+computer+security+%28safeguarding+computers+and+data+from+criminals%29%2CApple+%28Technology%29%2CViruses%2CMalware%2CComputing+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Kate+Bevan&c7=12-Apr-19&c8=1733001&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/2012/apr/19/mac-users-malware-flashback|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|5ce2eb91cbdcf44a6224a8db6bfddbd1402d9f58 -->",

        "body":"<p>Washington is desperately trying to avoid being drawn into the internal Chinese struggle that began <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/08/china-police-chief-wang-lijun-stress-leave\" title=\"\">with the attempted defection of a provincial official</a> in February and has since expanded to include <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/18/neil-heywood-killer-unforgiving-empress\" title=\"\">the suspected poisoning of British businessman Neil Heywood</a>.</p><p></p><p>As the scandal surrounding Bo Xilai and his wife Gu Kailai has spiralled into the biggest crisis confronting Beijing for years, US officials repeatedly refused to comment on the power struggle.</p><p></p><p>At the state department's daily press briefing on Wednesday, spokesman Mark Toner declined to discuss the issue in detail, particularly the attempted defection of the Chongqing vice-mayor Wang Lijun.</p><p></p><p>Toner stuck rigidly to a short, agreed version of events. \"Wang Lijun requested a meeting with the US consulate-general in early February. He was there on Monday 6 and left on Tuesday February 7. And he left by his own volition. But I can't talk about the discussions,\" he said.</p><p></p><p>Wang, who has a reputation as a crime-fighter, was a confidante of Bo, the former Communist party boss in Chongqing. His wife in under investigation in connection with Heywood's death.</p><p></p><p>Wang was refused asylum at the consulate in Chengdu and left the consulate 36 hours after his arrival. It has been widely reported that he spoke to US officials about corruption. Apparently fearing for his life if he remained in Chengdu, he  helped negotiate while at the consulate, with the aid of US officials, a safe conduct to Beijing, where he is now being held.</p><p></p><p>Given the embarrassment that Wang has caused and the fact that he went to the consulate seeking asylum, he could be severely punished.</p><p></p><p>Members of Congress are pressing the state department on why Wang was not given asylum, why the US failed to accept his offer of information about alleged corruption among high-ranking Chinese officials and why the diplomats may have put his life at risk by failing to grant him asylum.</p><p></p><p>Wang's arrival at the consulate came at a sensitive time, about a week before Xi Jinping, tipped as a future Chinese leader, was to visit Washington. If the US had granted asylum, it could have strained US-Chinese relations, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/world/asia/details-emerge-on-us-decisions-in-china-scandal.html\" title=\"\">according to the New York Times</a>.</p><p></p><p>The Times also reported that it would have been difficult to spirit him out of the country and, given his background in police work, it would also have been difficult to find grounds for asylum. Significantly, the issue went all the way up the chain to the White House for discussion while Wang was still in the consulate.</p><p></p><p>The Obama administration has increasingly engaged with China, establishing stronger ties and channels of communications while at the same time in competition over trade and over military and diplomatic influence in the region.</p><p></p><p>Toner said he was unaware of whether US diplomats had attempted to ascertain the status of Wang since leaving the consulate.</p><p></p><p>Asked why he had not been granted asylum, Toner said: \"Asylum cases follow a precise legal framework.\"</p><p></p><p>Asked if the US wanted to avoid being caught up in an internal Chinese power struggle, Toner replied:  \"It would not be my position to comment on internal Chinese politics \u2026 Let's end this line of conversation because it is not productive.\"</p><p></p><p>Bo's son, Bo Guagua, is a student at Harvard. The state department denied reports that he had been escorted from his flat by US security guards for his own protection. He remains a student at Harvard, US officials said.</p><p></p><p>There was however no sign of him at his apartment close to the university on Wednesday. A building manager would not comment when Bo Guagua's name was mentioned, and most people coming in and out of the seven stores building had not heard of the politician's son, who is studying for a masters in public policy. A sign that perhaps security was still tight at the apartment block came when the building manager rang the police following the Guardian's inquiries, who arrived within five minutes. The officers could shed no light on Bo Guagua's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Across the road from the apartment block, Guagua, said to be charismatic with a tendency towards the flamboyant, had made more of a mark.</p><p></p><p>A woman working in a dry cleaning business, who asked not to be named, said Guagua was \"very nice\", as well as being \"handsome\". He had been getting his cleaning done there for the last few months, she said, adding that he owned a lot of Dolce and Gabbana shirts. She said Guagua would normally be speaking on the phone in Chinese while he was in the shop. She said a couple of Chinese men had come into the shop in the latter half of last week asking about his whereabouts and spending habits.</p><p></p><p>There was no reply at the sprawling red brick house owned by Bo Xilai's sister, Jieying Bo, in Wellesley Hills, around 15 miles west of Boston.</p><p></p><p>Jieying has not been seen for over a year, last visiting in 2010, when she stayed for just a few days.</p><p></p><p>\"We're told it's for health reasons,\" said one neighbour, who asked not to be named. She said Jieying was \"a great neighbour, because she's never here\".</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=US+foreign+policy&k=China&k=Neil+Heywood&k=Bo+Xilai&k=Gu+Kailai&k=Asia+Pacific\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Washington+keeps+distance+from+China%27s+power+struggle+Article+1733329&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=US+foreign+policy%2CChina+%28News%29%2CNeil+Heywood%2CBo+Xilai%2CGu+Kailai%2CAsia+Pacific+%28News%29%2CWorld+news%2CUS+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+Washington+and+Adam+Gabbatt+in+Cambridge&c7=12-Apr-18&c8=1733329&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/19/washington-china-power-struggle|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|7508d1b921c5b69b65397311c041c20848ae2561 -->",

        "body":"<p>With American Bandstand, Dick Clark emerged as a pioneering rock'n'roll hit maker and annointer of kings. Elvis Presley, Madonna, Barry Manilow, the Jacksons, ABBA \u2013 all appeared on the show at some point during its massive run. </p><h2>Great balls of fire</h2><p>Here is Clark in 1958 introducing Jerry Lee Lewis in a scorching performance that needed no assistance.</p><h2>Role reversal</h2><p>In 1959, he was a special surprise guest on This is Your Life. Guests included Dick's parents, Richard and Julia Clark, from Utica, New York. Dick's father discusses the death of Dick's older brother, Brad Clark, in World War II.</p><h2>'You dipped your diphthong'</h2><p>Clark was enough of an icon by the mid-1960s that he'd land a cameo gently poking fun of himself on this episode of the original Batman television series. Extra points to the writers for getting Adam West to tell Clark \"you dipped your diphthong\".</p><h2>The 1970s</h2><p>John Travolta appeared on American Bandstand in 1976, already a television star but not yet the mega-celebrity he'd become after Saturday Night Fever which was released the following year. Is it just us or is Clark just the slightest bit uncharacteristically hostile here?</p><h2>Funny man</h2><p>In the 1980s, Clark struck gold with the show he produced \u2013 and hosted with Ed MacMahon \u2013 TV's Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes. Here they are co-presenting a blooper reel brought in by Elvira, the mistress of the night.</p><h2>Declining health</h2><p>Clark suffered a catastrophic stroke in 2004, which took him off the air for most of the rest of his life. He returned to New Year's Rockin' Eve alongside co-host Ryan Seacrest, noticeably diminished, to count down to 2006.</p><p><strong>Do you have a favorite Dick Clark moment?

The company was bought by Harold Tillman in 2009, and designer Joanna Sykes \u2013 a talent in the Phoebe Philo mould \u2013 was brought onboard in May 2010. But she had little time to reinvent the Aquascutum trench in four seasons, while the business model was always going to be problematic, says Martin Raymond, editor-in-chief of trend agency <a href=\"http://www.thefuturelaboratory.com/\" title=\"\">The Future Laboratory</a>. \"Unlike Burberry, Acquascutum doesn't own the licensing in Asia,\" he says. \"That is going to cause problems for any brand because that's where a lot of the money will come from.\"</p><p>These two brands have long been at war over this humble coat. Founded within five years of one another \u2013 Aquascutum in 1851, Burberry in 1856 \u2013 both claim to have created the original trench, so-called because it was designed for the trenches of the first world war. In the 50s and 60s Aquascutum was Hollywood's mac of choice, worn by Cary Grant, Sophia Loren and Humphry Bogart .</p><p>Burberry, meanwhile, had the <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://img.thesun.co.uk/multimedia/archive/00470/burberryBig_280_470734a.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/woman/fashion/1050167/Fashion-crimes-Burberry-Daniella-Westbrook.html&amp;h=390&amp;w=280&amp;sz=34&amp;tbnid=fYnoFcqE1BmKAM:&amp;tbnh=91&amp;tbnw=65&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DDanniella%2BWestbrook%2Bburberry%2Bimages%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&amp;zoom=1&amp;q=Danniella+Westbrook+burberry+images&amp;docid=H-Qas0VSlEzVSM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FOKOT6mCC-eG0AXe8tSCDQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ9QEwAA&amp;dur=2817\" title=\"\">Danniella Westbrook</a> moment. Photographed in head-to-toe Burberry check in the early 2000s, she linked the luxury brand with so-called \"chav\" culture. Arguably, this was the moment for Aquascutum to pounce. Instead, Burberry pulled a masterstroke: the appointment of ex-Gucci designer Bailey began to tell, then Angela Ahrendts, the American business brain, became CEO in 2006. Together they have revolutionised the brand, putting a modern spin on Burberry's heritage \u2013 with the trench at the forefront.</p><p>\"Heritage is a double-edged sword,\" says Raymond. \"Aquascutum is still talking about cavalry officers and bad British weather. Burberry has cleverly harnessed its heritage to innovation and edginess.\" Indeed, somehow wearing a Burberry trench now seems to nod to the Hollywood golden age, as if Acquascutum's heritage has been absorbed into Burberry's.</p><p>Look again at the two macs and you can see that the Burberry one is shorter, sharper, loucher (that belt), perkier. While it says \"now\", the Aquascutum says \"then\".</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/fashion&k=Fashion&k=Life+and+style&k=Burberry&k=Retail+industry&k=Business\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/fashion/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/fashion/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Tale+of+two+macs%3A+Aquascutum+goes+bust+while+Burberry+booms+Article+1733155&ch=Fashion&c2=148491&c4=Fashion%2CLife+and+style%2CBurberry+Group+%28Business%29%2CRetail+industry+%28Business+sector%29%2CBusiness&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Lauren+Cochrane&c7=12-Apr-18&c8=1733155&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: fashion/shortcuts/2012/apr/18/macs-aquascutum-bust-burberry-booms|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|d1a745f66a940854f045f3088b3ab5f0352e38f3 -->",

        "body":"<h2>A RIP-SNORTER AWAITS</h2><p></p><p>Barcelona versus Chelsea, the clash of a club that is reaping the luscious fruit of years of painstaking talent hot-housing and the club that is valiantly staving off the comeuppance of years of splurging pell-mell and hoping for the best. But that is not to say one is more likely to win than the other. Because while Barca boast mobility, finesse and enterprise, Chelsea offer PASSION AND BALLS AND BOTTLE (when they're in the mood). So it's tiki-taka v hurly-burly. Fancy dans v John Bull. Ball-hogs against war pigs. Chelsea may seldom touch the ball but when they get it, by George they shall hoof it. Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, Stamford Bridge must be a wet Tuesday night in Stoke.</p><p></p><p>And then, next week, Camp Nou must be a wet Tuesday night in Stoke. It's an order so tall that air traffic controllers are in a panic. Panic is good. Panic is Chelsea's friend. Panic could beat Barca. \"It's fair to say we need two perfect games from our point of view against this team,\" bellowed Roberto Di Matteo after watching England's Brave and Loyal John Terry endure an extra session of advanced loin-girding exercises. \"Barca don't like playing against us,\" roared Di Matteo anew, as Didier Drogba ran through his raging-striker-on-a-pogo-stick routine one last time. \"The way we play is maybe a bit more difficult for them to play against and we've shown on many occasions that we're a team who can give them problems,\" concluded Di Matteo before picking up Barca's bespoke silk gauntlet, snorting and throwing down a knuckleduster in reply.</p><p></p><p>\"I admire this generation of Chelsea players because it's not easy to achieve what they have done \u2013 lots of semi-finals, and a final, in Big Cup,\" retorted Pep Guardiola with irritatingly flawless politeness. \"They have changed a few players and coaches but their soul and spirit remain the same. Maybe they do not have the consistency for a league, but in competitions like this they are one of the best teams in the world. I am struggling to see how we are going to hurt them and how we are going to create chances to score goals.\"</p><p></p><p>Struggling to see a way for Barca to hurt Chelsea? Is that a suitably subtle flash of humour from the Barcelona conductor? Or did Chelsea manage to create a berserker atmosphere even for the pre-match press conference?</p><p></p><p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football\" title=\"\"><em>Join Paul Doyle for live MBM coverage of Chelsea 2-2 Barcelona from 7.30pm</em></a><em>.</em></p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p></p><p>\"I was saved in Sunderland. It's changed my life for the better \u2013 through Jesus's death\" \u2013 Black Cats midfielder Kieran Richardson reveals that he has been a born-again Christian for the past four years.</p><p></p><h2>RAISE YOUR CUPS TO THE BISCUITMEN</h2><p></p><p>After a play-off final defeat there's a little knot of sadness that never really leaves you. And such was the manner of Reading's defeat in the Championship version last year \u2013 when they were 3-0 down to Swansea inside 40 minutes \u2013 that it was no surprise when they started this campaign with all the vim and vigour of a moribund bullock. A home draw with Millwall, an away win at Leicester but then four defeats on the bounce left them 23rd and pondering a future where mid-table misery counts as success.</p><p></p><p>The Royals were not helped by the fact they lost their crown jewels \u2013 Shane Long to West Brom and Matt Mills to Leicester. But in their stead Brian McDermott brought in a couple of players with more points to prove than a baker of conical bread. In came Kaspars Gorkss, jettisoned by QPR having helped them to promotion, and Adam Le Fondre, Reading the club bold enough to take a chance on the little striker from Rotherham. The Latvian has proved the keystone in the tightest defence in the division, ALF the supersub and leading scorer.</p><p></p><p>But McDermott's mix still took a while to gel. Autumn saw improvement but, like the central heating in a miser's house, the club finally sparked to life once winter began to bite. In the 24 games since 3 December they have picked up 61 of a possible 72 points, 18 more than anyone else in the division and, crucially, 21 more than West Ham, who now seem certain to head into the play-offs.</p><p></p><p>It has been a run built on a solidity that is the envy of continents, a collective work ethic that would put a Trotskyite to shame, and set-pieces delivered by Ian Harte as juicy and dangerous as a steak laced with cyanide, not to mention McDermott's understated and spotlight-shunning management style.</p><p></p><p>\"In the summer I didn't see too much good coming out of our defeat at Wembley,\" said McDermott as the champagne corks popped around him after victory over Nottingham Forest secured promotion. \"But I had great support from family, friends, they've sacrficed so much and I had to go through all that to get to where we are now. If you are at our club, it's special. The environment is special, you can sense it. Go to the training ground, it's genuinely everyone together. If you have that bond, it's amazing what you can achieve.\"</p><p></p><h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2><p></p><p>\"Surely Teo Gutierrez (yesterday's bits and bobs) would be more suited to a move to Chelsea in the summer, given the weapon-related nature of his indiscretion at Racing Club?\" \u2013 Craig Anderson.</p><p></p><p>\"Re: Morocco's 1980 Eurovision song contest participation (yesterday's Fiver). Finally! The Fiver has strayed into territory that I can speak authoritatively on. As Morocco is part of the European Broadcasting area (not limited to geographical Europe) it is eligible to enter any contest it wishes, providing it meets certain criteria. They have chosen not to re-enter since 1980, rather than not being allowed to do so. Tunisia also intended to enter, but later withdrew and Lebanon managed to spectacularly muck up their intended entry by refusing to broadcast the Israeli entrant, as they don't recognise Israel, and were forced to withdraw and fined\" \u2013 Stuart McLagan.</p><p></p><p>Send your letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">the.boss@guardian.co.uk</a>.

It was the manager Steve Kean[-Out] who decided which players would be selected,\" moaned Givet, who should really be grateful.</p><p></p><p>Instead of just burning all the cash they have in a K Foundation-style publicity stunt, Man City are considering throwing £20m in Chelsea's direction for Daniel Sturridge, whom they sold to them for around £3m two years ago.</p><p></p><p>Carl Ikeme will get to enjoy Wolves's relegation from the Premier League after being recalled from Doncaster to cover for knee-knack-afflicted keeper Wayne Hennessey.</p><p></p><p>And Ryan Babel reckons it was nasty Damien Comolli's nasty businesslike manner and not his own inability to control a ball, run in a straight line or shoot within the boundaries of Liverpool 4, that was the reason for his Anfield exit. \"So Comoli [sic] got fired at LFC, good for L.F.C. For him it [my sale] was just business,\" tweeted the Hoffenheim winger.</p><p></p><h2>STILL WANT MORE?</h2><p></p><p>Floating football brain in a tank Jonathan Wilson tackles <a href=\"http://bit.ly/J8PEat\" title=\"\">the Question: \"How did Bayern outflank Real?</a>\" Funnily enough, \"Because they wanted it more\" is not his answer.</p><p></p><p>Dominic Fifield donned his best Columbo mac and scratched his head a lot while answering such questions as \"What's the reason for the sudden disappearance of Oriol Romeu?\" during <a href=\"http://bit.ly/J935r1\" title=\"\">his live webchat with Chelsea fans</a> ahead of tonight's Big Cup semi.</p><p></p><p>Having limbs that may snap at the slightest touch isn't a problem the Fiver has ever had to deal with, but Barcelona winger Isaac Cuenca has, though it hasn't stopped him impressing Pep Guardiola, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/IXXiVY\" title=\"\">says Sid Lowe</a>.</p><p></p><p>And when the Fiver saw Tony Hibbert's picture at the top of The Knowedge it presumed the question was \"Which player has blagged a living as a top-flight footballer for the longest time?\" <a href=\"http://bit.ly/IGRtp7\" title=\"\">It was actually about scoring droughts</a>.</p><p></p><h2>SIGN UP TO THE FIVER</h2><p></p><p>Want your very own copy of our free tea-timely(ish) email sent direct to your inbox?

        "body":"<p>David Cameron has backed a campaign to prevent the Northern Ireland attorney general suing the former Northern Ireland secretary Peter Hain on behalf of a senior judge by using century-old legislation of \"scandalising the court\".</p><p>The issue was raised by the former home secretary David Blunkett at prime minister's questions in the Commons.</p><p>An all-party campaign is being launched, designed to protect the freedom of MPs to comment on judicial rulings.</p><p>In a question to Cameron, Blunkett said: \"Shouldn't respect for the independence of the judiciary be balanced by the rights of individuals to fair comment on that judiciary?\"</p><p>The Northern Ireland attorney general, John Larkin, has been granted leave to prosecute Hain and Biteback Publishing over claims that a strongly worded passage in his memoir \"undermines the administration of justice\".</p><p>Cameron said MPs should be free to criticise the judiciary, just as judges should be allowed to attack politicians.</p><p>Cameron said: \"Parliamentary privilege obviously quite rightly allows MPs to express their views in parliament.</p><p>\"In terms of what is said outside parliament, let me just say this: there are occasions we all know when judges make critical remarks about politicians and there are occasionally [times] when politicians make critical remarks about judges.</p><p>\"To me, this is part of life in a modern democracy and I think we should try to keep these things as far as possible out of the courts.\"</p><p>A Downing Street spokeswoman said his remarks represented his view that judges should be able to take criticism, but she said he did not believe the prime minister had the power to order the case to be stopped. The decision had not been taken by a minister.</p><p>Hain has vowed to defend free speech against what his publisher said was an arcane law banning criticism of judges, which had not been used in living memory. Hain's remarks about Lord Justice Girvan's handling of a case caused controversy in Belfast when the book was published.</p><p>The lord chief justice, Sir Declan Morgan, described them as \"potentially an assault on the wider independence of the judiciary\".</p><p>Hain declined to back down and even renewed his criticism, sparking the legal action by Larkin. The case is listed for review by the divisional court in Belfast on 24 April.</p><p>The attorney general's court submission claimed the remarks, concerning the appointment of Bertha MacDougall as interim victims' commissioner, \"constitute unwarranted abuse of a judge in his judicial capacity that undermines the administration of justice in this jurisdiction, and consequently constitute a contempt of court\".</p><p>The statement adds that the book \"create[s] without justification a real risk that public confidence will be undermined in the judiciary\".</p><p>Hain said in a statement at the time of the attorney general's decision: \"I am astonished at this turn of events. I worked harder than anyone as secretary of state for Northern Ireland to uphold the rule of law and judicial independence and delivered the 2007 settlement which helped secure that.</p><p>\"If free speech and comment in a political memoir is to be suppressed then people will be entitled to ask: what system of justice prevails?\"</p><p>Judges such as Sir Stephen Sedley have successfully prosecuted newspapers for libel and have sometimes complained that they are shackled combatants on issues of public controversy.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/politics&k=Peter+Hain&k=Politics&k=David+Cameron&k=Northern+Ireland&k=UK+news&k=Law\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Cameron+backs+Hain+in+row+over+criticising+judges+in+memoir+Article+1732957&ch=Politics&c2=148491&c4=Peter+Hain%2CPolitics%2CDavid+Cameron%2CNorthern+Ireland+%28News%29%2CUK+news%2CLaw&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Patrick+Wintour%2C+political+editor&c7=12-Apr-18&c8=1732957&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: politics/2012/apr/18/cameron-backs-hain-judges-memoir|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|5862b0dc49d2e0620751c06c2f5b6787e60ee345 -->",

        "body":"<p>What links the suspected murder of China-based British businessman, Neil Heywood, with the  <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-destroyed-records-colonial-crimes\" title=\"\">part-publication  of long-hidden colonial files </a>from the last decade of the British empire? Why, Foreign Office and M16 secrecy, of course. Throw in Wednesday morning's news that Jack Straw is being sued  by a Libyan <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/apr/18/jack-straw-libya-rendition\" title=\"\">over his alleged role in extraordinary rendition </a>and the link is irresistible.</p><p>When I bumped into Labour's Denis MacShane on Tuesday, the MP was confident that he would seriously embarrass William Hague over the Heywood affair when he challenged him later that afternoon over the slow way in which the alleged crime emerged. You can catch it at <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120417/debtext/120417-0001.htm#12041733000021\" title=\"\">column 171 in Hansard </a>\u2013 though the foreign secretary seems to have survived unscathed.</p><p>Hague is reportedly asking the Beijing embassy, its spooks and diplomats, why it didn't flag up the gossip about light drinker Heywood's suspicious death and rapid cremation \u2013 the cause attributed to alcoholic excess \u2013 rather sooner. Straw, who last year denied in public that the then-Labour government had connived in any form of rendition, must be asking the FCO why he is being accused of having signed something which suggests otherwise.</p><p>In other words, the spirit of Yes Minister's Sir Humphrey lives on.</p><p>Of course, Foreign Office officials and the espionage community across the Thames at Vauxhall Cross are going to try to avoid making waves with mighty China over the death of a businessman operating in the shadows with powerful local friends. It's easy to imagine officials wanting to hush up the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/alexander-litvinenko\" title=\"\">troublesome murder of Russian exile Alexander Litvenenko </a> if he hadn't been poisoned so conspicuously with polonium in a London hotel. Hush things up and burn the files \u2013 or risk costly lawsuits, not all of them noble ones? It's not hard to follow their train of thought.</p><p>So what should we make of those surviving archives which are finally being released from the government's high-security centre in Buckinghamshire to the clutches of historians eager to get hold of them in the National Archive, close to Kew Gardens on the Thames in west London?</p><p>Tony Badger, Master of Clare College, Cambridge, who is overseeing the transfer, says that most of the colonial records were weeded and burned, that the rest should have been published under the old 30-year rule in the 80s and that the whole affair is \"embarrassing, scandalous\".</p><p>And so it is. It may be mere gossip, no less enjoyable for that, that British and US officials \u2013 ie the state department and FCO \u2013 fretted that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/18/barack-obama-father-colonial-list\" title=\"\">Barack Obama Snr was just the type of Kenyan scholarship student</a> to \"fall into the wrong hands\" in America and emerge \"anti-American and anti-white\". Since his own dad, Onyanga Obama, was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/dec/03/obama-grandfather-tortured here\" title=\"\">detained and possibly tortured during the Mau Mau emergency</a>, that's hardly surprising \u2013 as I have written before. President Obama seems content to overlook the offence; he has more important things to worry about.</p><p>But the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/18/archives-diego-garcia\" title=\"\">mistreatment  of the 1,500 citizens of Diego Garcia</a>, exiled in the 1960s to create the huge Indian Ocean military base so crucial to American global power projection, cannot be but a poignant story, heartlessly cruel and probably avoidable. Again, the initial injustice and expediency has been compounded by secrecy and obstruction.</p><p>Kenya, Cyprus, the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/18/colonial-office-eliminations-malayan-insurgency\" title=\"\">Malayan  emergency in which British colonial forces inflicted a rare defeat on a communist-led jungle insurgency</a> \u2013 the files which have survived will still provide plenty of useful insights. Malaya fascinated the Americans, who tried and failed to repeat its counter-guerilla techniques (remember \"secure hamlets\"?) in Vietnam a decade later.</p><p>Yet context usually provides some mitigation for such actions, occasionally justification, which it is wise not to dismiss out of hand. Nothing reported in Wednesday's newspapers about British excesses would at first glance match what the Belgians did for decades in the Congo \u2013 Europe's worst colonial scandal,  the Germans in what is now Namibia or the French in Algeria, the legacy of whose imperial retreat lives on.</p><p>That's no excuse, but it is context. So is the atmosphere of the 1950s which I dimly remember, when Stalin's armies occupied the eastern half of Europe and word was slowly emerging of the scale of atrocity committed during and after the Terror and the second world war \u2013 5 million Stalin victims in addition to the 20 million Russian dead at the hands of the Germans.</p><p>With China in Mao's hands we were all scared of what the \"red menace\" might be about to do to the rest of us. Paranoia was particularly acute in the United States of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism\" title=\"\">McCarthy  era</a>, when bad things were done in the name of liberty, but often mixed up with race. Ed Pilkington reported  only this week on the 40-year <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/16/angola-prison-forty-years-solitary-confinement\" title=\"\">solitary confinement of two black Americans</a> caught up in the tail-end of that madness and still protesting their innocence.</p><p>But just because it is easy with hindsight to condemn or mock the excesses of the time doesn't mean our parents and grandparents weren't right to be nervous \u2013 or even that the often-brutal suppression of the Malayan insurgency  didn't do modern Malaysia, conspicuously prosperous and relatively open, a historic favour. Just think about neighbouring Burma.</p><p>The cold war was often frightening and always corrosive, but it did have a point. Whether its peaceful ending in the collapse of the Soviet Union and its bloc after 1989 has ushered in better times or merely a relatively benign interlude remains to be seen. Edward Lucas's new book Deception (Bloomsbury, £20) suggests we are foolish to underestimate the continuing threat to Britain posed by Russian espionage \u2013 often conducted not by goons and oligarchs, but by modern young Russians with PhDs and nice accents. US worries about cyberwarfare focus on China, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/16/militarisation-of-cyberspace-power-struggle\" title=\"\">as Nick Hopkins reports</a>.</p><p>As Julian Assange's WikiLeaks exercise showed, though many readers were too indignant to notice, the cable traffic it revealed tended to expose more of the double-talk of the states Washington has to deal with than outright US perfidy. But the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/apr/18/colonial-papers-fco-transparency-myth\" title=\"\">condemnation of Britain's failings </a>by Harvard professor and author of Britain's Gulag (Holt/Cape), <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Elkins\" title=\"\">Caroline Elkins</a>, does warrant a gentle riposte.</p><p>Her history of Britain's suppression of the Kenyan Mau Mau revolt \u2013 very brutal too in its own way \u2013 won a Pulitzer prize, though Oxford's David Anderson covered much of the same bloody ground in his Histories of the Hanged: Britain's Dirty War in Kenya and the End of Empire (Weidenfeld and Nicholson) in the same year of publication.</p><p>Most of this ugly stuff is known, it's often the context which is forgotten. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-poison-gas-tests-botswana\" title=\"\">Poison gas  tests in an isolated corner of Botswana</a>? They never actually happened, but Britain feared the Germans might use it first \u2013 as they did in 1915.</p><p>But Americans should always resist the easy temptation to take too much moral high ground over the Brits. They have their Kenyas and their Diego Garcias too and are usually as selectively amnesiac as we are. Thus, the predominantly black, southern city of Washington DC boasts a haunting Holocaust Museum. But when I looked at the bench on which Jews were not allowed to sit, I thought of the countless benches in the American south on which \u2013 in the same decade \u2013 African Americans were not allowed to sit either.</p><p>As for Native Americans, when I lived in the US I was often struck by how small were the newspaper archives discussing their continuing plight and problems, compared with those of African Americans. Some might see the whole country as their Diego Garcia.</p><p>So almost the last thing I did before returning to Britain was visit the Pine Ridge reservation \u2013 home of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wounded_Knee_Massacre\" title=\"\">Wounded Knee Massacre  of 1890</a>. It is not a pretty sight. History is moving on and the west is slowly being judged for its failings as well as its achievements.</p><p>From here on others will be writing their own accounts of the past 500 years of European expansionism, now over. Some of them, I dare say, will be committing atrocities of their own against the weak too.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=National+Archives&k=Foreign+policy&k=Politics&k=UK+news&k=US+foreign+policy&k=World+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Colonial+papers+and+the+ugly+legacy+of+empire+%7C+Michael+White+Article+1732911&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=National+Archives+%28News%29%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CUS+foreign+policy%2CWorld+news%2CAfghanistan%3A+the+war+logs%2CThe+war+logs%2CIraq%3A+The+war+logs&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Michael+White&c7=12-Apr-18&c8=1732911&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/blog/2012/apr/18/colonial-papers-ugly-legacy-empire|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|95571c5214cd4016d81d93ac2e03a19d4572277e -->",

        "headline":"Tim Berners-Lee: demand your data from Google and Facebook",
        "body":"<p>Tim Berners-Lee, the father of the world wide web, has urged internet users to demand their personal data from online giants such as Google and Facebook to usher in a new era of highly personalised computer services \"with tremendous potential to help humanity\".</p><p></p><p>Berners-Lee, the British born MIT professor who invented the web three decades ago, says that while there has been an explosion of public data made available in recent years, individuals have not yet understood the value to them of the personal data held about them by different web companies.</p><p></p><p>In an interview with the Guardian, Berners-Lee said: \"My computer has a great understanding of my state of fitness, of the things I'm eating, of the places I'm at. My phone understands from being in my pocket how much exercise I've been getting and how many stairs I've been walking up and so on.\"</p><p></p><p>Exploiting such data could provide hugely useful services to individuals, he said, but only if their computers had access to personal data held about them by web companies. \"One of the issues of social networking silos is that they have the data and I don't \u2026 There are no programmes that I can run on my computer which allow me to use all the data in each of the social networking systems that I use plus all the data in my calendar plus in my running map site, plus the data in my little fitness gadget and so on to really provide an excellent support to me.\"</p><p></p><p>Berners-Lee, who has been an outspoken defender of the \"open internet\", said big web companies were beginning to respond to consumer pressure to make users' data more easily recoverable. Google now offers users immediate access to all data it holds on them and Facebook will send users their data, though it may take as long as three months to recover all of it.</p><p></p><p>Once the data outputs from different sites had been standardised, he said, our computers would be able to offer increasingly sophisticated services such as telling us what to read in the morning. \"It will know not only what's happening out there but also what I've read already and also what my mood is, and who I'm meeting later on.\"</p><p></p><p>Berners-Lee has in the past warned that the rise of social-networking \"silos\" such as Facebook, and  \"closed world\" apps such as those released by Apple, which cannot be indexed by web search engines, threaten the openness and universality that the architects of the internet saw as central to its design.</p><p></p><p>He said he was still worried about the effect of hugely dominant or monopolistic companies but believed that the greater ability of small companies to innovate meant  it was unlikely that the current web giants would maintain their dominance indefinitely.</p><p></p><p>\"It's interesting that people throughout the existence of the web have been concerned about monopolies. They were concerned [about] Netscape having complete control over the browser market until suddenly they started worrying that Microsoft had complete control of the browser market. So I think one of the lessons is that things can change very rapidly.</p><p></p><p>\"Before the web, Gopher [an early alternative to the world wide web] was taking over the whole internet, it seemed, very quickly. I remember in an internet engineering meeting, somebody remarked that it was incredible how quickly it was taking over. One of the wiser people said: 'Well it's funny, it's amazing how quickly people on the internet can pick something up, but it's also amazing how quickly they can drop it.'\"</p><p></p><p>He said web users needed to be more conscious that websites that seemed to be permanent fixtures of the online world could disappear within a few years. \"Whatever social site, wherever you put your data, you should make sure that you can get it back and get it back in a standard form. And in fact if I were you I would do that regularly, just like you back up your computer \u2026 maybe our grandchildren depending on which website we use may or may not be able to see our photos.\"</p><p></p><p>Berners-Lee said he was concerned by the rise of so-called \"native apps\" such as those produced for the iPhone and iPad because they were not searchable. \"Every time somebody puts a magazine on a phone now and doesn't put it on to a web app [a form of open software] you know we lose a whole lot of information to the general public discourse \u2013 I can't link to it, so I can't tweet it, I can't discuss it, I can't like it, I can't hate it.\"</p><p></p><p>But he said the rapid improvement of web apps, and their ability to offer functionality and slickness previously only available from Apple or Android apps would return more information to the open internet.</p><p></p><p>In a clear dig at Apple's highly restrictive ecosystem he said: \"I should be able to pick which applications I use for managing my life, I should be able to pick which content I look at, and I should be able to pick which device I use, which company I use for supplying my internet, and I'd like those to be independent choices.\"</p><p></p><p>He said he was also concerned about the rise of relatively restrictive smartphones, at the expense of PCs or Macs. \"One of the things I like about the computer that I use is that I can write a program on it or I can download a program on to it and run it. That's kind of important to me, and that's also kind of  important to the whole future of the internet \u2026 obviously a closed platform is a serious brake on innovation.\"</p><p></p><p>He is most worried by moves by some makers of laptop operating systems to \"lock those down too, because they like the environment of the locked-down phone\". He said such limited operating systems could improve security but  \"on the other hand this is the end of the road for the general innovative space which is general computers.\"</p><p></p><p>Berners-Lee was speaking to the Guardian as part of its week-long series on the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/series/battle-for-the-internet\" title=\"\">battle for control of the internet</a>, examining how states, companies and technological developments are challenging the principles of openness and universal access on which the net was built.</p><p></p><p>Acknowledging growing concerns about online privacy, he said computer users received significant benefits from the vast amount of data that big web companies accumulate about them but that increasingly they would seek to apply limits to how the data could be used.</p><p></p><p>\"If I go to a shop and I buy some clothes, it's helpful if the clothes shop remembers what size I am because I'm terribly bad at remembering \u2026 Instead of preventing people from getting information together we're moving towards a world in which people agree not to use information for particular purposes \u2026 so [for instance] making sure that an insurance company, even if its insurance agent happens to be a friend of a friend of yours on Facebook, won't use that information to set your premium.\"</p><p></p><p>He said the development of a \"do not track\" protocol, currently being debated by the Federal Trade Commission, would increase web users' confidence that data about them was not being abused \u2013 by \"flipping a switch\" on their browsers they will be able to instruct websites not to track their online behaviour.</p><p></p><p>Of all internet developments, Berners-Lee said those costing him the most sleep were attempts by governments to tighten their control of or spy on the internet, which he said amounted to \"a destruction of human rights\". He was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/17/tim-berners-lee-monitoring-internet\" title=\"\">highly critical</a> of British government plans to expand surveillance of communication to include emails, social media and Skype, as well as monitoring all web use by individuals.</p><p></p><p>But he also said he was worried by the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, a proposed US bill that would increase the government's ability to enforce patents and copyright.</p><p></p><p>\"[It] is threatening the rights of people in America, and effectively rights everywhere, because what happens in America tends to affect people all over the world. Even though the Sopa and Pipa acts were stopped by huge public outcry, it's staggering how quickly the US government has come back with a new, different, threat to the rights of its citizens.\"</p><p></p><p>\u2022 <strong>Explore the seven-day special series on the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/series/battle-for-the-internet\" title=\"\"><strong>Battle for the internet</strong></a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Tim+Berners-Lee&k=Google&k=Facebook&k=Technology&k=Internet&k=Social+networking\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Tim+Berners-Lee%3A+demand+your+data+from+Google+and+Facebook+Article+1732724&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Tim+Berners-Lee+%28Technology%29%2CGoogle+%28Technology%29%2CFacebook%2CTechnology%2CInternet%2CSocial+networking%2CMedia&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ian+Katz&c7=12-Apr-18&c8=1732724&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/2012/apr/18/tim-berners-lee-google-facebook|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|5cdf62a4b523e4430a1e30da9b179d286d17bda2 -->",

        "body":"<!-- Block 27 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">6.14pm:</span> One last drop of joy from Mitt Romney charming picnic with regular voters in Pennsylvania today, via AP:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>As he sought to parry the inevitable Democratic accusations, Romney also tackled a second, if unspoken concern, a perception that he has difficulty establishing rapport with middle-class voters. To that end, his campaign arranged an outdoor event in a Pittsburgh suburb at which the wealthy former businessman-turned-politician and eight area residents sat amicably around a picnic table and talked about economic issues.</p><p>There was one fleeting moment of awkwardness, when Romney guessed that a plate of cookies set out on the table were from \"a local 7-Eleven bakery or whatever,\" instead of a local firm, Bethel Bakery.</p></blockquote><p>A \"local 7-Eleven bakery or whatever\"? My local 7-Eleven does hot dogs and pizza of dubious vintage. Not sure if that counts as a bakery, or even whatever.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">5.49pm:</span> So it has come to this: the Romney campaign feels it has to \"distance itself\" from Ted Nugent because ... well, anyway:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Divisive language is offensive no matter what side of the political aisle it comes from. Mitt Romney believes everyone needs to be civil.</p></blockquote><p>Also, apple pie is pleasant. When asked by the presumably bored members of the White House press corp about Nugent, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com//blogs/burns-haberman/2012/04/wh-not-piling-on-nugent-120822.html\">Politico reports Jay Carney's sensible reply</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Asked about the Nugent remarks at the White House briefing, Carney said he wasn't familiar with what the foul-mouthed musician said, but noted: \"The president has said, and I and others have said, that we can't be policing the statements of supporters across the board.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 25 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">5.28pm:</span> Accusations of anti-Mormonism may get tiresome between now and the general election in November, but the New Republic's <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-stump/102735/manufactured-outrage-religious-edition\">Alec MacGillis is on the case</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Well, that didn't take long. You had to figure it would just be a matter of time before Team Romney alleged anti-Mormon bias by its opponents or the press, and bingo, today we had two separate instances of the charge being raised. And in both instances, it was groundless. There will surely be moments in months ahead when the accusation is merited. But flinging the charge around like this is hardly the way to start things off.</p></blockquote><p>So far the only \"anti-Mormonism\" I can recall was during the Republican primaries.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">5.19pm:</span> The Guardian's Ed Pilkington is working on the news that the <strong>American Legislative Exchange Council</strong>, the controversial lobbyists whose work includes sponsoring \"stand your ground\" gun laws, has said it is dropping:</p><p>That's quite a development.</p><p>Here's the <a href=\"http://www.alec.org/2012/04/alec-sharpens-focus-on-jobs-free-markets-and-growth-announces-the-end-of-the-task-force-that-dealt-with-non-economic-issues/\">statement from Alec's national chairman</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We are eliminating the Alec Public Safety and Elections task force that dealt with non-economic issues, and reinvesting these resources in the task forces that focus on the economy. The remaining budgetary and economic issues will be reassigned.</p></blockquote><p>Presumably this is the result of protests that put pressure on Alec members such as McDonalds and Coca-Cola to withdraw their support, after the Treyvon Martin case focussed attention on Alec role in pushing similar legislation.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.56pm:</span> The most double-edged Republican endorsement of the day for <strong>Mitt Romney</strong> came from Louie Gohmert, the Republican congressman from Texas, via AP:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>If you're not sure about wanting to support Mitt Romney, whether you're liberal, whether you're very conservative, you ought to be excited because he's been on your side at one time or another.</p></blockquote><p>Tongue in cheek or foot in mouth?</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.38pm:</span> Another piping-hot endorsement and ringing vow support for <strong>Mitt Romney</strong>, this time from the Republican governor of Pennsylvania Tom Corbett:</p><p>OK so that's not exactly Mel Gibson's speech in Braveheart but that will do.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.55pm:</span> The blogger <strong>Duncan Black</strong> \u2013 better known as Atrios \u2013 is so old he <a href=\"http://images1.americanprogress.org/il80web20037/ThinkProgress/2006/atriosww.320.240.mov\">once appeared in an episode of the West Wing</a>. As a blogger called Atrios.</p><p>To celebrate ten years of blogging, Black has now completed his magnus opus: a Top 10 list of <a href=\"http://www.eschatonblog.com/2012/04/final-countdown.html\">Wankers of the Decade</a>. And there can be only <a href=\"http://www.eschatonblog.com/2012/04/one-true-wanker-of-decade.html\">one winner: the New York Times's Thomas Friedman</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Truly great wankers possess a kind of glib narcissism, the belief that everything is about them while simultaneously disavowing any responsibility for anything. The important thing about an issue is whether it proves Tom Friedman fucking right, but if it doesn't we can just move on to the next big thing that will prove Tom Friedman fucking right. If you advocate for wars that go a bit bad, well, it's not your fault. If only Tom Friedman had been in charge everything would have been great.</p><p>Such wankers are impervious to criticism because they're always doing battle with straw critics. They never remember what they said last week, and assume you won't either.</p></blockquote><p>Atrios remembers, though, and reminds us of this fabulous piece of Friedman video from 2003, with Friedman's immortal \"Iraq: suck on this\" line. Unforgettable.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.33pm:</span> <strong>Mitt Romney</strong>'s campaign event of the day was an entirely natural-looking picnic event with carbon-based life forms and registered voters in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania.</p><p>As we can see pictured above, there was nothing staged or awkward about this picnic. Here's the <a href=\"http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/12108/1224938-455.stm\">Pittsburg Post-Gazette</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Kelly Wassel, a Greensburg public school nurse whose husband is a private-plane mechanic, told of her worries about paying college costs for her two kids and of public school funding cuts.</p><p>\"I think this election will come down to jobs and kids,\" Mr Romney responded.</p></blockquote><p>Sounds like the RomneyBot 2000 needs a software upgrade for the general election.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.02pm:</span> New Jersey governor <strong>Chris Christie</strong> is not trying very hard to disclaim any interest in the vice presidential ticket for Mitt Romney.</p><p>Christie <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/christie-would-listen-if-romney-asks-him-to-be-running-mate/\">told ABC News</a> that he's \"not looking to become vice president\". But on the other hand...</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>He continued, saying if  \"Mitt Romney calls and wants to discuss it with me, I will sit down and talk with Governor Romney about it.\"</p><p>Christie said the former Massachusetts governor knows it's not a job he's interested in.</p><p>\"He knows that it's not my desire, my lifelong wish to be vice president of the United States, so the fact is if he comes and talks to me about it I'll certainly listen and listening means going into it with an open mind,\" he said.</p></blockquote><p>Now that's a classic of some sort. So: I don't want the job, Mitt Romney knows I don't want the job but if he asks me I might.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.41pm:</span> Yes it's another one of those pretty-much-useless <strong>opinion polls</strong> out today \u2013 but <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/04/17/with-voters-focused-on-economy-obama-lead-narrows/\">this one is from Pew Research</a>, which is serious and credible.</p><p>The Pew poll's top line is that the economy remains the biggest issue in the minds of voters.

So my plan would toughen key financial penalties tenfold and impose these penalties not just per violation, but for every day a violation occurs.</p><p>Third, Congress should give the agency responsible for overseeing oil markets new authority to protect volatility and excess speculation by making sure that traders can post appropriate margins, which simply means that they actually have the money to make good on their trades.</p></blockquote><p>\"None of these steps by themselves will bring gas prices down overnight,\" Obama says, redundantly.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.25am:</span> <strong>President Obama</strong> is now speaking at the White House's Rose Garden on the need for increased supervision of the oil markets.</p><p>\"Obviously, rising gas prices means a rough ride for a lot of families,\" says Obama, noting that some people \"have no choice but to drive 50 or 60 miles to get to their jobs\".

        "body":"<p>Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is distancing himself from the author of some of the toughest anti-immigration laws in the country, Kris Kobach, the first in what is expected to be a series of moves aimed at winning over crucial Latino voters.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/04/kobach-is-not-mitt-romneys-immigration-adviser-120792.html \">Politico reported today</a> that Kobach, responsible for the tough anti-immigration legislation in Arizona and other states, has been demoted from Romney's \"adviser\" on immigration policy to a \"supporter\".</p><p>Romney highlighted the role of Kobach in his campaign during the Republican primaries in states such as South Carolina, where there is a strong anti-immigrant feeling. But with the primaries all but over, Romney is beginning to pivot toward a position more sympathetic to Latinos.</p><p>Polls consistently show Barack Obama enjoying a two-to-one advantage over Romney among Latinos, a huge majority that could be the determining factor in the White House election. Romney, speaking at a fundraiser at the weekend, admitted his campaign was doomed if he could not win over Latinos.</p><p>Politico asked Romney's campaign headquarters in Boston if Kobach was still an adviser. A Romney spokesperson emailed back to say he was \"a supporter\".</p><p>Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod, labelled this as evidence of Romney offering one set of views to Republicans for the primaries and caucuses and another for the general electorate.</p><p>Axelrod tweeted: \"Etch-a-Sketch moment. After telling donors he's 'doomed' unless he picks up with Latinos, Mitt puts kibosh on Kobach.\"</p><p>The change in status came as news to Kobach. He <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/special/2012/04/17/466091/romney-disowns-kobach\">told ThinkProgress</a> that he continued to provide advice on immigration policy. </p><p>Kobach, 45, a former constitutional law professor, is at present secretary of state for Kansas. He co-authored anti-illegal immigration policies not only in Arizona but Alabama, Missouri and Oklahoma, and he has given advice to other states. These policies have resulted in confrontations between the Obama administration and Arizona and other states which have introduced hardline immigration policies. The constitutionality of the issue is to be tested in the US supreme court next week.</p><p>In February, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/feb/24/kris-kobach-immigration-law-mastermind\">Kobach told the Guardian</a> that Romney had discussed imposing a nationwide crackdown on illegal immigrants if he were elected president. Kobach estimated that within the first four years of a new Republican presidency, as many as half of the current pool of undocumented immigrants \u2013 some 5.5 million people \u2013 could be made to flee by much more aggressive enforcement of immigration laws.</p><p>Romney first employed Kobach as an adviser on immigration in his failed 2008 bid for the Republican nomination. Romney has not directly described Kobach as an adviser, but he was effusive in January welcoming his endorsement.  </p><p>\"We need more conservative leaders like Kris willing to stand up for the rule of law,\" Romney said at the time. \"With Kris on the team, I look forward to working with him to take forceful steps to curtail illegal immigration and to support states like South Carolina and Arizona that are stepping forward to address this problem.\"</p><p>Kobach has repeatedly described himself as an adviser to the campaign.</p><p>Romney could help himself with Latinos by choosing someone such as Florida senator Marco Rubio as his vice-presidential running mate or proposing a Republican version of the Dream Act that would offer a route to citizenship for illegal immigrants.</p><p>There is disappointment among many Latinos with Obama over his failure to tackle immigration issue as he promised in the 2008 campaign. But so far, misgivings about him among Latinos have been overriden by the hostile rhetoric toward immigrants from Romney and other Republican candidates during the primaries and caucuses.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Mitt+Romney&k=US+immigration&k=US+elections+2012&k=Barack+Obama&k=United+States&k=World+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Romney+campaign+tries+to+distance+itself+from+key+immigration+adviser+Article+1732712&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Mitt+Romney+%28News%29%2CUS+immigration%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CBarack+Obama+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news%2CArizona+%28News%29%2CDream+Act+%28US+immigration%29%2CKansas+%28News%29%2CUS+politics&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-17&c8=1732712&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/17/mitt-romney-campaign-immigration-adviser|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|974fe63b4de029facd22971e46ecd1e854ead7e2 -->",

        "body":"<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for those who are watching season five of Mad Men on Sky Atlantic. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode five</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/apr/10/mad-men-season-five-episode-four\" title=\"\">Paul MacInnes' episode four blog</a></p><h2>\"This is an office, we're supposed to be friends\" \u2013 Pete Campbell</h2><p>Pete Campbell has nothing. Only last week he had it all. But this week, it's vanished, the lot of it. At least that's what he's telling Don Draper. And when you've spent years trying to get the man round for dinner, why would you lie to him?</p><p>Let's look at the possible causes of Catastrophic Pete Collapse Syndrome. Work? Nah, he may not have any new business, but neither does anyone else while Mohawk's still in the air \u2013 and Heinz and Jaguar aren't exactly his problems. Is it at home? Again no. He has a loving wife who'll put the squeeze on any recalcitrant guest if it gives her husband the chance to act like lord of the manor for an evening. (The best moment of physical acting this week was surely Vincent Kartheiser's swollen, bumptious body language as he held court from the top of his dining table). Is it Pete's fashion sense? It should be, but sadly it isn't. Is it Don Draper? It just might be.</p><p>When I say Don Draper, I'm not referring simply to the increasingly sweaty creative dynamo of Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce. The meaning of Don extends beyond that, symbolising masculinity, obduracy, existential self-determination. Don is a man who can fix blown valves, resist dinner party invitations (but play nice when finally compelled into attendance) and exhibit sexual temperance after a lifetime of indulgence. A man who is attractive to women half his age. Also a man who could probably win a fist fight with a short-sighted Englishman. When Pete says he has nothing, what he really means he is not Don. And all he wants is Don to take him in his arms and call him \"my son\". That, it's fair to say, ain't about to happen.</p><p>Last week I wrote that Pete is in an odd position at SCDP; that he belongs to neither of the clashing generations, that he is neither old nor young. The way in which he is passed over by his student driver, without much in the way of deliberation, for the aptly named Handsome reminds Pete of his age. And not only does he end up fighting with a member of the older generation, the rest of the elderly just stand back and refuse to take his side. And \u2013 just in case it requires saying \u2013 even after all that I still have no sympathy for the man.</p><p>Well it seemed likely that there'd be another eruption from lascivious Lane and so it proved, with a spring and a kiss on Joan's unsuspecting lips. First thing to note is how calmly she deals with the whole thing; neither curtailing nor extending the kiss, but standing up immediately afterwards and opening wide the door to Lane's office just so nothing further can occur. To me this spoke of somebody who has had this experience before and someone for whom discretion is important. But, and I may well be wrong here, I didn't think the kiss was entirely rejected. It was only two episodes ago, after all, that Joan turned to Lane in her hour of need. Last week she was forced to evict her husband, which was not without its emotional consequences (despite his behaviour). I think something consensual might happen in future. But then again I've just got a thing for stiff, English guys.</p><p>While the dynamic between Don, Pete and Ken chez Campbell was somewhere between forced and furious; that between Megan, Trudie and Cynthia was entirely different. Relaxed in each other's company \u2013 even enjoying it! \u2013 they were happy to leave their egos at the door, even to the extent of cooing over another's fella. (\"Look, it's Superman\" says Cynthia, with only half a smirk on her face). Just another reminder of why the world would be a better place if women were in charge (Angela Merkel being the exception that proves the rule).</p><p>So the man still appears to have no actual job (though for that matter, neither does Bert Cooper or, increasingly, Don). But we are reminded this week that Roger Sterling is not entirely out to pasture, nor devoid of relevant skills. He briefs Lane on how to dine his new friend from Jaguar. \"Half way through the entree they'll throw out something revealing ...\" Roger says. \"During dessert let him know you've got a similar problem.\" It doesn't work, but it certainly sounds like it should. Later he takes Ken aside to bring an end to his career as \"Ben Hargrove\". (How did he come up with the name?). That Roger unwittingly occasions the birth of Dave Algonquin is another unfortunate coincidence. And then there's the trip to the bordello that ends with Mrs Jaguar severing all contact with SCDP. Again it was well-intentioned and \u2026 OK, I'm not really doing a good job at selling this idea.</p><p>Conclusion: Roger is continuing to act like a buffoon and his works are not successful. But that doesn't mean they won't be.</p><h2>This week's other notes</h2><p>I appreciated the cultural differences in the fighting stances taken by Lane and Pete. The Englishman making like Sherlock Holmes in The Sign of the Four. The American acting all casual like Muhammad Ali. But, surely, at least one of them should have sought to protect his own face?</p><p>\"Let's make a baby\" \u2013 Megan is surprised by Don's come on. Will he try it again? And how will Megan's maternal instincts (or otherwise) react?</p><p>Algonquin <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algonquin\" title=\"\">can mean a number of different things</a>.</p><p>Just to keep up with the suggestion that homosexuality is the greatest taboo on Madison Avenue, there's both the oblique references to rent boys made by the madam to Don, and Pete's typically crass declaration to Lane just before the fight: \"He thinks you're a homo!\"</p><h2>Culture club</h2><p>Lane: \"I don't know if you are aware, but England won the World Cup!\"</p><p>Roger: \"Cup of what?\"</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG_8E7-CVxY\" title=\"\">World Cup</a> was a soccer, or \"football\" tournament that took place during July 1966. It was eventually won by England, who accepted the prize graciously and didn't bang on about it for decades.</p><h2>Science-fiction/fantasy</h2><p>Ken's furtive success with The Punishment of X4 was not the only sign that science-fiction was taking off in the States. Despite the fact Ken has to explain it by using the suffix \"fantasy\", sagas of rockets and robots were becoming ever more mainstream. Star Trek debuted on network TV in this year while another, older TV show, Fantastic Voyage, became a big summer movie. There <a href=\"http://www.etsy.com/listing/85457649/vintage-sci-fi-book-the-runaway-robot\" title=\"\">was also this</a>; Ben Hargrove might wish to contact his lawyers.</p><h2>Time stamp</h2><p>Charles Whitman \u2013 note how Don is so quick to point out the correct pronunciation of his name \u2013 killed 16 people from the top of a tower on the University of Texas campus. His behaviour was variously explained as having been caused by his experiences in the Marine Corp and the development of a tumour on his hypothalamus.

Anger over the lavish spending has led to the cancellation of a series of scheduled conferences by federal employess in other holiday destinations.</p><p>Both Republicans and Democrats expressed outrage over the Las Vegas partying on Tuesday, the second day of the hearings into the affair.</p><p>Republican Congressman Jeff Denham said Tuesday: \"Where crimes have been committed, people will go to jail.\" He threatened to \"systematically pull apart\" the government agency responsible.</p><p>Details of the spending come at a politically sensitive time, with Republicans in particular expressing concern over the scale of federal spending and the burgeoining national debt.</p><p>One of the congressional hearings was told no evidence could be found of any substantive agenda for the conference in October 2010 at the M Resort and Spa and Casino, in Henderson, on the outskirts of Vegas. Instead, staff spent $823,000 on food, a clown, a mind-reader, bikes for a team-building exercise that were later donated to children, and trips by staff and their families to the  Vegas Strip, and a commemorative coin. About 300 staff attended the conference.</p><p>The bike-building exercise cost $75,000, the commemorative coins $6,325 and breakfast $44 per person.</p><p>The House transportation and infrastructure committee held its hearing Tuesday following one on Monday by the House oversight and government reform committee.  Reflecting how much the affair has incensed members of Congress, two other Congressional committees are also lined up to hear evidence.</p><p>The staff worked for the general services adminstration (GSA), which looks after the federal government's real estate.</p><p>The offical in charge of the conference, Jeffrey Neely, opted against giving evidence, citing his right to remain silent.  He did not turn up for the Tuesday hearing.</p><p>The abuse of taxpayers' money in Las Vegas was first uncovered by Brian Miller, inspector-general of the GSA who published a report on his findings on April 2, leading to a series of sackings. He gave evidence on Monday and Tuesday at separate hearings and said on Monday that he had asked the department of justice to consider.</p><p>Investigations were continuing, Miller said. \"We do have other ongoing investigations including all sorts of improprieties, including bribes, possibly kickbacks but I'd have to check precisely on kickbacks,\" Miller said.<br />He added:  \"We have recommended criminal charges.\"</p><p>The head of the GSA has resigned and the new acting administrator, Dan Tangherlini, said he is working with Miller to recover the money spent. He also revealed he had cancelled 35 planned GSA conferences that would have cost about $1m.</p><p>Robert Peck, who was fired as commissioner of the public buildings service, is among staff who have been asked to repay at least part of the cost of the Las Vegas trip.   </p><p>Peck gave evidence Tuesday to the House transportation and infrastructure hearing into what was billed as a hearing into the 'squandering of taxpayer dollars: a pattern of mismanagement, excess and waste'.</p><p>Peck said that while he had been on the Las Vegas trip, he had not been involved in the planning. He described the expenses claimed for the conference as \"excessive and unacceptable\".</p><p>He has been sent a letter by the GSA demanding reimbursement of $1,960 for a party in his room in Vegas.</p><p>Neely has been asked to pay back $2,717.</p><p>Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings, quoting from a report, claimed Neely had said: \"I know I'm bad, but \u2026 why not enjoy it while we have it and while we can; ain't going to last forever.\"</p><p>A Republican Congressman, Trey Gowdy, focused on the bike-building exercise after which the completed bikes were given to boys and girls clubs. \"Giving bicycles to indigent children is a beautiful thing,\" Gowdy said. \"Lots of people do it. I just hate that you robbed yourself of the satisfaction by using other people's money to do it.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=US+politics&k=United+States&k=US+Congress&k=Republicans&k=Democrats\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=GSA+staff+could+face+criminal+charges+for+extravagant+conference%2C+hearing+told+Article+1732606&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=US+politics%2CUS+news%2CUS+Congress%2CRepublicans+%28US%29%2CDemocrats&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+Washington&c7=12-Apr-17&c8=1732606&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/17/gsa-government-spending-criminal-charges|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|f306c7239cf4b30c84a44458262cc7b51e15b310 -->",

In her column today, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/apr/16/charitable-giving-tax\">Polly Toynbee describes it as \"probably the most bungled budget in history, fiscally neutral yet politically incendiary \u2013 mainly for that 50p top tax cut\".</a></p><p>It would be good to be able to put this in context. Can anyone think of any other contenders for the title of worse budget ever? By worst, I mean worst in political terms - because they have damaged the popularity of the governing party, or because they have created problems that require embarrasing U-turns. You could also try to list the worst budgets in economic terms, but that really opens up a different argument.</p><p>All thoughts welcome.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.34am:</span> The Resolution Foundation has published<a href=\"http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/us/downloads/minimum-wage-maximum-wage/MinimumWageMaximumImpact.pdf\"> a report on the minimum wage (pdf).</a> It says the value of the minimum wage has been falling in real terms in recent years and it suggests three reforms that could address this. Here's an extract.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The idea of introducing a premium NMW [national minimum wage] for older workers, for example those over 30, has merit. This would have the added benefit of making the minimum wage somewhat better targeted on low-income households.  The downside is that older workers do not earn so much more (at the lower percentiles of the distribution) than younger workers, meaning that any adult premium minimum would be not be much higher than the current adult NMW. <br /> <br />The second possibility we have considered is a higher minimum wage forLondon.  Earnings in London are much higher than in the rest of the UK so the current NMW has less impact in London than it might. A higher rate in this region could lift the wages of large numbers of workers. Although there would be practical difficulties there is little reason to think they would be insurmountable.  <br /> <br />Finally, we have considered what could be learned from the approach of the living wage. As we saw, the method of computing the living wage delivers a number that is far too high to be considered as a national, mandatory minimum wage.  A narrative that views a living wage as an alternative to existing support through the welfare system, in particular tax credits, overlooks the fact that an hourly wage for individual workers can never guarantee a minimum standard of living at the household level, where living standards depend on the hours of work and the number of children. That said, these limitations take nothing away from the fact that higher hourly wages would help to raise household income. The living wage campaign <br />has demonstrated the virtues of a voluntarist approach. There may be a case for doing more to leverage the authority of the LPC to change pay norms. Asking the LPC to take a judgment on non-mandatory 'affordable' minimum wages in different sectors might be one way of raising the pressure on employers who pay unnecessarily low wages, as well as shining a light on sectors of our economy that are dependent on unsustainably low levels of pay. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.44am:</span> Here are the headline inflation figures.</p><p><strong>\u2022 The consumer prices index (CPI) measure of inflation rose to 3.5% in March, from 3.4% in February.</strong></p><p><strong>\u2022 The headline rate of retail prices index (RPI) inflation fell to 3.6% in March, from 3.7% in February.</strong><br /><strong><br />\u2022 The underlying rate of retail prices index (RPI) inflation fell to 3.7% in March, from 3.8% in February.</strong></p><p>Here's <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/march-2012/index.html\">the news release from the Office for National Statistics.</a> And here's <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/march-2012/stb---consumer-price-indices---march-2012.html\">the ONS statistical bulletin with the full details (pdf).</a></p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9.48am:</span> And here's an extract from the Press Association story about the inflation figures.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><br />A fall in the number of supermarket promotions saw the rate of inflation unexpectedly rise last month, official figures revealed today, piling more pressure on hard-pressed families.<br />The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rate of inflation rose to 3.5% in March, from 3.4% in February, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, halting five months of declines.<br />Food and non-alcoholic drinks fell 0.5% on the month but this compared with a 1.4% fall last year when supermarkets and other retailers offered a wider range of sales and special offers.<br />The rise in inflation will rattle Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King and his colleagues, who previously predicted that CPI would fall swiftly back throughout this year to the Government's 2% target. <br />Households were squeezed by high prices and sluggish wage growth throughout 2011 and some relief from the high cost of living was expected this year.<br />The Bank will now be less inclined to pump more money into the economy through its quantitative easing programme if inflation continues to remain above target.<br />The average cost of petrol and diesel at the pump hit a record high in March, up to £1.38 and £1.46 a litre respectively.<br />However, the ONS said the rise in fuel and lubricants was similar to last year so had little impact on the rise in inflation.<br />The biggest upward pressure came from the softer drop in food bills, a smaller fall in recreation and culture costs and higher clothing and footwear prices.<br />Fruit, bread and cereals and meat saw prices rise in March, compared with falls a year ago, which acted as a drag on the overall food category.<br />The softer fall in prices follow a fierce price war between the supermarkets, as Tesco introduced its Big Price Drop, Sainsbury's fought back with its Brand Match scheme and Asda offered its Price Guarantee.<br />But Tesco, which reports annual results tomorrow, admitted its £500 million scheme had been a flop after dismal trade over Christmas continued into the new year.<br />Clothing and footwear prices were up 2.2%, driven by women's outerwear, while recreation and culture saw resistance from higher charges for toys and recording media.<br />There was some downward pressure in March as big six energy suppliers Scottish Power and EON introduced cuts to their tariffs.<br />Housing and household services costs, which includes electricity and gas, subsequently dropped 0.2% on the month.<br />Elsewhere, transport costs fell on the month as second-hand car prices fell by 0.1%, compared with a 1.5% rise last year.<br />Alternative measures of inflation did fall, however, with the retail price index dropping to 3.6% in March from 3.7% in February. </p></blockquote><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.23am:</span> Tube workers are going to go on strike next week.

I haven't had time to do some proper research, and so the considered thesis on this is going to have to wait, but the comments have been interesting. Here are some thoughts.</p><p>1. Most respondents, here and on Twitter, think that Gordon Brown's budget abolishing the 10p rate of tax was worse. I agree. The 10p decision was a timebomb in Brown's final budget (in 2007) and it did not explode until 2008, when Brown finally accepted that his move was going to penalise the low paid and Alistair Darling had to spend £2.7bn in an emergency budget repairing the mess. Arguably Brown's reputation never fully recovered. There are similarities. The 10p budget undermined Brown's claim to be on the side of the poor. The 2012 budget has undermined George Osborne's claim that \"we're all in it together\". But he won't end up spending £2.7bn repairing the damage (not least, because he can't afford to).</p><p>2. If you want to impress your friends, you can tell them that this budget (or the 10p budget - see above) is the worst budget since Sir Francis Dashwood's cider tax in 1763. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cider_Bill_of_1763\">According to Professor Wikipedia, it provoked riots.</a> (Like Osborne, Dashwood made the mistake of offending voters in the West Country.)</p><p>3. Some budgets are deemed bad because they contain measures that are unpopular. And some are deeemed bad because they unravel. In the comments,<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/15679843\"> Opimian</a> has an interesting take on this.</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>@Andrew, I'm sure there have been budgets that have been more unpopular on the day. My main memory of 50 years of budgets is of 24 hours of fury over increases in alcohol and cigarette duty. Attitudes to both smoking and drinking were different in the past and duty increases were considered to be an outrageous attack on the innocent pleasures of the working man and woman. Today, because of health concerns, most people just shrug and overlook the fact that these are regressive taxes and have little deterrent effect on the rich.</p></blockquote><p>4. That said, this budget does seem to contain a large number of features that are unpopular and unravelling. We've already had arguments about the abolition of the 50p rate, the pasty tax, the granny tax, VAT on church repairs, the impact of the tax relief cap on charities and caravans. Personally, my theory is that the new rules about the abolition of child benefit for high earners - involving a fiendishly complicated sliding scale - could turn out to be even more problematic for Osborne.</p><p>5. Political impact does not always correlate to economic impact. In this budget Osborne was shuffling around relatively small sums of money. (He is spending about £3.5bn raising the personal tax allowance, and funding that through a variety of relatively minor tax increases.) There are many other budgets (and spending reviews) that have had a far greater impact on personal finances. In the comments, in what I presume is a reference to pension indexation, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/15684367\">akamalaccas</a> says the 2010 budget cost him or her 30% of future income.

        "headline":"Why businesses should turn their food waste into compost",
        "body":"<p>It had been a few years since I travelled through Seattle's airport, so I did a double-take when I saw compost bins in the main food court. Although the airport has had a composting plan in place for a few years, this was still new to passengers, including me. That brief experience in Seattle signalled a trend in how the private sector can work on waste diversion efforts. For now food waste is not high on most companies' sustainability agenda, but interest is increasing. As it should be.</p><p>In the United States, <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/organics/food/fd-basic.htm\" title=\"\">food scraps</a> were the second largest contributor to municipal waste in 2010. Even after recycling, food waste was the largest contributor to landfills with almost 34m tonnes discarded that year. Food waste is a huge emitter of <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/methane/sources.html\" title=\"\">methane</a>, with 120m tonnes of emissions coming from landfill sites in the US in 2009.</p><p>More food companies are starting to compost their waste, from local breweries to large supermarket chains like Whole Foods. The fight to keep food scraps out of landfill is an uphill climb, however. Suggestions that MacDonalds should test composting, sent by young franchisees to its corporate headquarters, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203918304577239400999617684.html\" title=\"\">have been as well received as</a> requests to install rooftop gardens on top of its restaurants. But the food industry is not the only sector that can do more to divert food scraps away from landfills. Companies large and small can work with local government to ensure that waste from cafeterias and catered events be put to better use.</p><p>One pilot programme brings together a chemical company with America's favourite pastime. Just10 miles away from Seattle airport, the chemical company <a href=\"http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/32924-Seattle-Mariners-BASF-Partner-on-Zero-Waste-Goal-at-Safeco-Field\" title=\"\">BASF</a> has partnered with the Seattle Mariners baseball franchise to increase the team's already impressive record on composting. BASF contributes rubbish bags made out of its bioplastics so that the team's stadium operations can haul away everything from peanut shells to compostable utensils. Over 80% of organic waste, about 400 tonnes of food waste and grass clippings, are now composted annually. BASF wins through the promotion of its Ecovio compostable plastic; the city of Seattle benefits from a cleaner and more hygienic method to haul trash from the 48,000-seat ballpark while cutting down on local greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Another innovative project involves several local companies' headquarters. Cincinnati is home to several large American corporations, including Kroger, Procter &amp; Gamble and Macy's. These companies are part of the <a href=\"http://www.gcgbc.org/_files/GCGBC-Workplace-Composting-Toolkit.pdf\" title=\"\">Greater Cincinnati Green Business Council</a>, which is pushing local businesses to ramp up sustainability programs. The group has started by distributing workplace compost kits to companies across the region. <a href=\"http://news.cincinnati.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/AB/20120304/BIZ/303040019/\" title=\"\">Procter &amp; Gamble</a> now composts food at company cafeterias serving 6,000 employees and will soon roll out the program to its other corporate locations. Realising that such an initiative involves behavioural change, the company posts big signs that point out the differences between the different bins while workers assist employees with sorting their waste at the end of their meals. Other large firms with local offices in southern Ohio, including Duke Energy and Mitsubishi, have also committed to the programme's success. The waste is then hauled to local farms where it is processed and composted.</p><p>What has started in Cincinnati is a model for other cities across the country. True, for many small and medium businesses, composting is not an obvious item on the sustainability to-do list. But in countless downtown towers and office parks, they create enough food waste to match that of America's larger corporations. Working with property management companies and local organic farms, business can turn a pesky annoyance into a way of boosting their green credentials and decreasing their greenhouse emissions.</p><p><em>Leon Kaye is founder and editor of </em><a href=\"http://greengopost.com/\" title=\"GreenGoPost.com\"><em>GreenGoPost.com</em></a></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"Guardian Professional\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

        "body":"<p>The head of the Metropolitan police has promised to personally oversee a cultural change within the force and pledged to resolve six remaining cases of alleged racism within four weeks.</p><p>Bernard Hogan-Howe told MPs he would drive out racist police officers in the Met. The force was receiving about one complaint a day alleging racism, he said.</p><p>The commissioner was summoned to give evidence amid mounting concern over a string of cases relating to alleged racist comments, assaults and bullying within Britain's largest police force.</p><p>Earlier the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced it would charge a Met constable, Alex MacFarlane, over allegations he was captured on a mobile phone racially abusing a black suspect.</p><p>Hogan-Howe told the home affairs select committee he was pleased the CPS had reviewed its previous decision not to charge MacFarlane, although he stressed that the case against MacFarlane remained an allegation. \"I am glad that it will now be tested in court,\" he said.</p><p>The Labour chair of the committee, Keith Vaz, said Hogan-Howe was the latest of several Met commissioners to promise to stamp out racism. He said evidence of officers using words such as \"nigger\" would undermine confidence in the force.</p><p>Hogan-Howe said: \"That word, which you repeated but which I try and avoid, leaves you wondering what is in someone's heart for them to be able to say it? Police officers, and all of us, get angry and irritated at times, but I don't know how someone finds it within themselves to use that word \u2013 or anything like it.\"</p><p>On the wider issue of racism, Hogan-Howe said: \"I condemn any racist in the Met. I am not going to stand for them being in the Met \u2013 and I will drive them out. Whatever is in my power to do something about that, I will do.\"</p><p>There are now 11 separate cases of alleged Met racism under investigation. They involve 20 police officers, eight of whom have been suspended, and one civilian staff member. Five officers have been placed on restricted duties. Seven of the officers under investigation are based in the Olympic borough of Newham.</p><p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission is dealing with five of the cases, including the investigation into MacFarlane. The other six are being handled by the Met internally. Hogan-Howe said he wanted those cases completed \"within four weeks\".</p><p>He said he would consider whether any disciplinary hearings arising from the six cases could be held in public. The force would unveil a new approach to the use of stop and search within weeks.</p><p>Hogan-Howe said he did not support proposals to create an independent body to monitor how the force deals with issues of discrimination. The number of complaints the Met received was small in proportion to the size of the force.</p><p>The Met received 14,000 complaints a year, he said. \"If you break it down, it is less than one [complaint] per borough, per day.\" He said 2.4% of complaints \u2013 about 320 annually \u2013 had a \"racial allegation\" within them.</p><p>Hogan-Howe said he would personally lead \"a piece of work\" to change the culture within the Met. He said his proudest achievement in his previous role, as chief constable of Merseyside police, was the fact the force had the lowest number of complaints per head of any force in the country.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=UK+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Met+police+chief+pledges+to+drive+out+racist+officers+Article+1732417&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=UK+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Paul+Lewis&c7=12-Apr-17&c8=1732417&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/17/met-police-chief-drive-out-racists|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|0194f07bd1fcfbfc5b3cc0bbaaa00ad4a713b2d5 -->",

        "headline":"Walled gardens look rosy for Facebook, Apple \u2013 and would-be censors",
        "body":"<p>It was in May 2008 that Jonathan Zittrain first sounded the warning. While the argument was raging, as it is now, about censorship of the internet by governments seeking to control what their populations read \u2013 in countries such as China, India and Pakistan \u2013 the professor of cyberlaw at Oxford and Harvard universities had another concern: what if it were actually the gadgets we used that were in effect censoring the world that we could connect to, and the things we could do?</p><p>Zittrain fretted that smartphones, which were just beginning to take off, might actually limit what users could do online compared with devices such as personal computers. Besides the obvious difference \u2013 a smartphone is light and can be slotted in a pocket; a personal computer is power-hungry and bulky \u2013 there's another subtle but essential difference. Personal computers are \"generative\": they can be programmed to do more than they were set up to. Smartphones, on the other hand, generally can't be programmed directly by the user. For the most part, they're appliances, as limited in what they can do as a coffee maker.</p><p>In his book, The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It, Zittrain noted: \"We care little about the devices we're using to access the net \u2026 we don't think of that as significant to its future the way we think of [direct censorship].\"<br /><br />But does the rise of appliance-like smartphones \u2013 and more generally of \"walled gardens\" such as Facebook, Myspace and Google+ \u2013 presage an age where we simply cut ourselves off from uncomfortable truths online because our devices, or the sites we use, won't show them to us, like a North Korean radio made so it cannot be tuned to unauthorised sources?</p><p>The question is urgent. Facebook has passed 845 million users, and smartphones are outselling PCs so quickly that in 2010 the research company Gartner forecast that as soon as next year mobile phones will overtake PCs as the most common way to access the web, used by 1.82 billion people, compared with 1.78bn net-connected PCs.</p><p>But answering it is complicated, says Dr Richard Clayton of Cambridge University's computer laboratory, who has extensively researched the censorship and oversight systems used by many countries and companies, including the UK and British Telecom's \"CleanFeed\" system, used to filter child pornography.</p><p>\"Facebook can cause people to disappear from history, vaporising their pages and everything they wrote on your wall, as if they were never there,\" he points out. For Facebook, everything \u2013 every user, every wall entry, every photo \u2013 is just an entry in a giant database, which can be removed at any time by someone with access to that database. (It could be you, or an administrator.) The complication comes in trying to suggest that doing that or <em>not</em> doing that is \"wrong\".</p><p>\"Everybody applauds the idea that there shouldn't be an open space where paedophiles swap material,\" says Clayton. \"Or where al-Qaida can swap material and recruit. And then it gets harder \u2013 you have Facebook groups where you have Muslims who want to march through Luton to protest about our activities in central Asia. Facebook has a rather fun arrangement so that they can set up groups like that, but they aren't visible in the UK [where they would count as hate speech].\"</p><p>So Facebook roots out what it considers against good taste, which (as Clayton points out) generally means content that would not be allowed under the US first amendment, since it is an American company. A <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/feb/21/facebook-nudity-violence-censorship-guidelines\" title=\"\">guidebook for its moderation staff</a> recently became public, revealing that images of breastfeeding would be banned if nipples were exposed, but deep flesh wounds and crushed heads would be OK.</p><p>While such rules seem peculiar in Europe, almost to the extent of being the reverse of what is expected, Google has also demonstrated the same American prudishness on its Google+ social network, which insists on people using their real names.</p><p>As San Francisco-based journalist-turned-venture capitalist MG Siegler discovered, the site banned him from using a photo with a rude gesture \u2013 an extended middle finger \u2013 for his profile; when Siegler reposted it, Google removed it again. The key to the problem: Google wanted to show Google+ profile pictures in search results, and if those included pictures that some might find offensive, Google could lose business.</p><p>Censorship? Heavy-handed US-biased restriction? Or reasonable move to keep the web clean? Tom Anderson, the co-founder of Myspace, who was automatically everyone's friend when they first joined, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/112063946124358686266/posts/SMhmTHjuRuu\" title=\"\">wrote an open letter (on Google+) to Siegler</a>, in which he said: \"Every social network has the policy you're decrying, and why shouldn't they? It's a public sphere.\" He compared it to wearing a racist T-shirt in a shopping mall: \"Security would probably ask you to leave.\" He added that it had been very difficult at Myspace to keep up with \"offensive\" photos; without that control, a social network \"turns into a cesspool that no one wants to visit \u2026 sorta like Myspace was\".</p><p>But social networks played a big role in the Arab spring of 2011, with Facebook and Twitter both cited as key to getting the message out from oppressed groups. More recently, Syria has become the source of many important videos showing the suffering of citizens attacked by their own government. Those can be seen on YouTube \u2013 though not, of course, by citizens within Syria itself.</p><p>The fears about \"walled gardens\" sometimes reflect concerns that are as much about business models as principles.</p><p>Facebook does not let Google or any other site index the vast majority of its content; a tiny file called robots.txt on its homepage stops search engines from grabbing details of photos, feeds or other data. Only the most limited information can cross that wall \u2013 and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/apr/15/web-freedom-threat-google-brin\" title=\"\">that worries Google</a>, which relies on being able to index everything (don't forget its mission statement: \"organise the world's information and make it universally available\") and then to sell adverts against it.</p><p>John Battelle, who runs online advertising network Federated Media, says Facebook poses an existential threat to Google. \"The old internet is shrinking and being replaced by walled gardens over which Google's crawlers can't climb,\" he <a href=\"http://battellemedia.com/archives/2012/02/its-not-whether-googles-threatened-its-asking-ourselves-what-commons-do-we-wish-for.php\" title=\"\">noted earlier this year</a>, as Facebook prepared its flotation. \"Sure, Google can crawl Facebook's 'public pages', but those represent a tiny fraction of the pages on Facebook, and are not informed by the crucial signals of identity and relationship which give those pages meaning.\"</p><p>In the same way, Apple's iTunes store is available on the web, and Google can index it, \"but all the value creation in the mobile iPhone and iPad app world is behind the walls of Fortress Apple. Google can't see that information, can't crawl it, and can't make it universally available.\"</p><p>In that sense, as Facebook gets bigger, and sells advertising to its users, it poses an increasing threat to Google \u2013 because to many, the space outside Facebook will look more and more like an untamed space where scams, malware and piracy thrive. \"Google's business model depends on the web remaining open, and \u2026 that model is imperilled,\" Battelle adds. \"The open web is full of spam, shady operators and blatant falsehoods. Outside of a relatively small percentage of high-quality sites, most of the web is chock full of pop-up ads and other interruptive come-ons.</p><p>\"It's nearly impossible to find a signal in that noise, and the web is in danger of being overrun by all that crap. In the curated gardens of places like Apple and&nbsp;Facebook, the weeds are kept to a minimum, and the user experience is just \u2026 better.\"</p><p>Even video sites such as YouTube and Vimeo can be thought of as a form of walled garden: videos are removed at the request of copyright owners and law enforcement. Often, they're dismissed as just being repositories for \"cute cats\" videos (with user-generated films such as \"Charlie bit my finger\" still near the top of the all-time list). But as Ethan Zuckerman, director of MIT's Centre for Civic Media, pointed out in a Vancouver Human Rights lecture, <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/episodes/2012/02/24/the-vancouver-human-rights-lecture---cute-cats-and-the-arab-spring/\" title=\"\">Cute Cats and the Arab Spring</a>, sites such as YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter are the best place for dissidents to post grievances and findings.</p><p>Those sites don't offer the best protection for dissidents, Zuckerman argues \u2013 for people can often be identified through their posting or web identity \u2013 but their power is that governments, even repressive ones, block them at their peril. If YouTube suddenly becomes invisible, people begin to wonder why and begin to ask questions \u2013 which in time, given the connectedness of our modern civilisation, will mean that they find out.</p><p>An earlier version, from 2008, pointed to how the <a href=\"http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2008/03/08/the-cute-cat-theory-talk-at-etech/\" title=\"\">overhead views of Google Maps had shown precisely who owned property in Bahrain</a> \u2013 which often turned out to be the royal family. But what about the mechanisms that are increasingly being used to foment or report revolution \u2013 the smartphones with internet connectivity, or the computers being used to upload photos or video taken with cameraphones?</p><p>Zittrain has expressed fears about how the devices we use to connect to the net have moved away from being fully capable personal computers \u2013 where in theory you can write programs that can use any capability of the computer \u2013 towards appliances such as the iPad or iPhone, with tightly limited functionality and access to the underlying operating system software, where only \"allowed\" programs can be installed from a vendor-maintained store. He calls such a process \"tethering\".</p><p>\"From the start my worries about appliances permanently tethered to their makers have been that the tethering won't be limited to smartphones,\" Zittrain sayss. \"Rather, the closed smartphone architecture is the canary in the coalmine for all of consumer computing. That's why I've said the PC is dead, even as the PC's form factor may remain. In the past year we've seen the introduction of the App Store on the Mac PC \u2013 not just iPhone and iPad.\"</p><p>Even Microsoft, which ushered in the era of the personal computer running software that in theory could be used to write any program, is heading in the same direction. Versions of Windows 8, to be released in the autumn, will also use Metro Store for apps, which Microsoft will control.</p><p>Adding new programs will be hard; in effect, websites will become the new programs. Zittrain notes that although you can still side-load software \u2013 that is, transfer it from another source, such as the internet or a memory stick connected to the machine, that is a reversal from the paradigm that ruled for years.</p><p>\"What a transformation: the principal way of acquiring software for the past 30 years is now through a side door rather than a front one,\" he says. \"I'm both awed and worried about what's happened since 2008.\"</p><p>Zittrain concedes that people like convenience and security \u2013 and they're entitled to. But he says there's a qualitative difference between now and then. \"No one tried to get Bill Gates to alter Windows so that undesirable apps and associated content \u2013 undesirable to someone other than the user \u2013 couldn't be accessed. Today is different: if Facebook or Apple allow objectionable apps on their platforms, or Google in the Android Marketplace, or Microsoft in the Metro Store, regulators can say: take it down.\"</p><p>That's a subtle shift, but important. Media commentator Jeff Jarvis says Apple's iPad is \"sweet and pretty but shallow and vapid ... I see danger in moving from the web to apps,\" he said. \"The iPad is retrograde. It tries to turn us back into an audience again.\"</p><p>The same broad criticism is applied to smartphones, where not just Apple's product, but almost all platforms prevent any sort of easy access to the underlying code; there's no \"command line interface\" for a smartphone, no black screen and blinking cursor as you can find on a Windows or Apple computer, if you look hard enough.</p><p>Part of that is for the protection of the wider telephone network, says Clayton. \"Because  phones are talking to the wider telecommunications system, which isn't secure, the wireless side of phones tends to be locked down very tight.\"</p><p>But on the app side, the extent of user lockdown varies between platforms. Apple's iPhone is tightly controlled: you can't distribute an app on to iPhones except by putting it through Apple's App Store \u2013 and the company has previously removed apps in China at the government's behest, such as in 2009, when apps about the Dalai Lama were removed.</p><p>In that, Apple was like Google, which at the time maintained an operation inside China, and self-censored its content, offering a link to Chinese searchers to explain why the content was censored \u2013 but not to ways to find the results they wanted. Apple offered no such indication that the store was censored.</p><p>With smartphones now outselling PCs every quarter, and China forecast to become the world's largest smartphone market this year, ahead of the US, the question of whether smartphones are a \"reductive\", limited platform, or \"generative\" like a PC looks like an increasingly important one.</p><p>Battelle says the shift to mobile is unstoppable. \"The PC-based HTML web is hopelessly behind mobile in any number of ways,\" he wrote on his blog. \"It has no eyes (camera), no ears (audio input), no sense of place (GPS/location data). Why would anyone want to invest in a web that's deaf, dumb, blind, and stuck in one place?\"</p><p>Yet that wealth of data on mobiles isn't necessarily leading to a more web-like experience. Clayton says that \"we are seeing more locked-down platforms than before\" on smartphones \u2013 pointing particularly to Apple, but not excepting others.</p><p>The biggest, and best-selling, exception is Android, the smartphone software that Google offers free to handset makers. \"With Android, there's a wider choice of where to download apps from\" \u2013 many companies, including Amazon, offer their own Android \"app stores\" \u2013 \"and Google doesn't hold your hand as much.\" The search giant can still \"kill\" apps if it judges them to be malware.</p><p>So far, there do not seem to have been any occasions when the Chinese government has demanded that an Android app is wiped from phones \u2013 though its Great Firewall can prevent people inside China accessing the official Android Market from which apps can be downloaded, rendering the problem moot. Indeed, Android Market has been blocked a number of times inside China, and many users there prefer the unofficial ones that have sprung up; though those, of course, will come under the eye of the government.</p><p>In total, Android is outselling all other smartphone platforms \u2013 though probably not because eager would-be programmers and tinkerers are taking it up, but because carriers can offer them cheaply. \"[Apple's iPhone and iPad software] iOS and [Google's] Android now represent fascinating hybrids,\" says Zittrain. \"Third parties can write apps \u2013 and how they do! \u2013 but the manufacturer, to varying degrees, can control whether those apps can reach their audiences.\"</p><p>Even so, there's no easy answer. For example, the success of Research In Motion's BlackBerry phones in many Middle Eastern countries has come about because they allow teenagers to communicate directly with the opposite sex, without having to meet face-to-face \u2013 because that could fall foul of strict religious laws. Similarly, Facebook offers a way for teenagers to \"speak\" in ways that might be banned in the physical world. To some teenagers \u2013 and activists \u2013 the fact that the BlackBerry's PIN-based Messenger system can't be tied to a phone, yet lets people stay in touch, is the perfect reason for using the platform. Though it can be decrypted \u2013 if the government goes to great lengths \u2013 in general it will be private, which suits its younger users perfectly.</p><p>Zittrain's real worry is that <a href=\"http://www.technologyreview.com/printer_friendly_article.aspx?id=39163\" title=\"\">\"the personal computer is dead\"</a>.</p><p>His conclusion is a call to arms: \"We need some angry nerds\" \u2013 people capable of breaking out of the walled gardens.</p><p>Indeed, the US government has found some: it has backed projects such as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/12/world/12internet.html?_r=3&amp;ref=todayspaper&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">\"the internet in a suitcase\"</a>, which could set up a telecommunications network inside a country separate from the existing infrastructure.</p><p>Zittrain acknowledges such projects, but for the wider world, he says, \"convenience is great. I wouldn't call for a return to the green blinking cursor of [Microsoft's pre-Windows] MS-DOS or the [text-based] Apple II. But we should build architectures that permit innovation and experimentation if consumers wish to go 'off-roading'.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Internet&k=Technology&k=Facebook&k=Media&k=Smartphones&k=Social+networking\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Walled+gardens+look+rosy+for+Facebook%2C+Apple+%E2%80%93+and+would-be+censors+Article+1732149&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Internet%2CTechnology%2CFacebook%2CMedia%2CSmartphones%2CSocial+networking%2CWorld+news%2CCensorship+%28News%29%2CMicrosoft+%28Technology%29%2CApple+%28Technology%29%2CComputing+%28Technology%29%2CTablet+computers%2CMobile+phones+%28Technology%29%2CGoogle+%28Technology%29%2CGoogle%2B%2CApps&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Charles+Arthur%2C+technology+editor&c7=12-Apr-17&c8=1732149&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/2012/apr/17/walled-gardens-facebook-apple-censors|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|ab9514e9a69cce2a0cc034e724fef2ae7fa9a36e -->",

        "body":"<p>A police officer who was recorded on a mobile phone allegedly racially abusing a black suspect inside a van has been charged, reversing an earlier decision in which prosecutors decided he should not face charges.</p><p>Metropolitan police constable Alex MacFarlane was recorded allegedly making the comments to a suspect arrested days after the riots last summer.</p><p>The suspect, Mauro Demetrio, 21, used his mobile phone to record the encounter. In January the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) initially decided not to bring criminal charges against MacFarlane or another police officer who Demetrio alleged strangled him in the back of a police van. Last month the CPS agreed to review its decision after being threatened with legal action by Demetrio's lawyer, Michael Oswald.</p><p>Alison Saunders, chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said  there was \"sufficient evidencefor a realistic prospect of conviction\" to charge MacFarlane with a racially aggravated public order offence.</p><p>\"When a review shows a previous decision not to prosecute is wrong, it is open to the CPS to rectify that error by bringing new proceedings,\" Saunders said.</p><p>\"I have taken the decision in this case that, as well as there being sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction, and a prosecution being in the public interest, a prosecution is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the criminal justice system. That is the test I must apply under the code for crown prosecutors when reinstituting a prosecution.\"</p><p>\"Accordingly I have advised the Independent Police Complaints Commission to charge PC MacFarlane.\"</p><p>She added: \"It is regrettable that the original decision was wrong, but I hope the action taken and my decision today demonstrates the willingness of the CPS to review its decisions independently and swiftly and to take appropriate action where necessary.\"</p><p>The CPS said additional charges would not be brought in relation to Demetrio's allegation that he was strangled inside the van, in part due to \"the inconsistencies in the various accounts of what happened\".</p><p>Accounts were given by Demetrio and seven other police officers in the van.</p><p>\"The inconsistencies included a dispute over the identity of the officer who took hold of the complainant; the complainant said that this was one officer but all other witnesses dispute this,\" Saunders said.</p><p>\"There is also inconsistency over why the officer, who does accept that he took hold of the complainant did so; he and other witnesses say it was in response to the complainant's apparent aggression and in self-defence. I agree with the conclusion that in the circumstances there is insufficient evidence to meet the code test for bringing charges.\"</p><p>The CPS is still considering a second case, in which a 15-year-old black teenager, Terelle Ferguson, alleges he was assaulted by officers in Forest Gate police station.</p><p>Saunders added: \"All parties have now been informed. Can I please remind all concerned that PC MacFarlane is charged with a criminal offence and has a right to a fair trial. It is very important that nothing is said, or reported, which could prejudice his trial.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=UK+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Police+officer+accused+of+racially+abusing+black+suspect+charged+Article+1732320&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=UK+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Paul+Lewis&c7=12-Apr-17&c8=1732320&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/17/police-officer-accused-racial-abuse-charged|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|7125f9ba303c2ad23990234c4499ad01986fe77f -->",

However, a rating upgrade to Baa2 could be triggered by (i) the Windows devices rivaling the market positions of the Android-based leaders, (ii) by group revenues starting to grow again and operating margin (1.0% Moody's adjusted for 2011) reaching high single digit percent, while (iii) maintaining a net cash position (about EUR3.1bn Moody's adjusted per end of 2011). For an outlook stabilization, (i) the Lumia family of devices needs to prove traction by gaining substantial market share and returning the Smart Devices segment to non-IFRS operating profit, (ii) the Mobile Phones segment should at least stabilize its sales volumes and return to a double-digit contribution margin, and (iii) cash consumption fall to marginal levels.</p></blockquote><p> Nokia bonds remain at investment grade, but only just.

        "headline":"A Scottish earthquake that could bury Ed Miliband",
        "body":"<p>In days gone by there were some comforting certainties about Glasgow life. The <a href=\"http://lyndseymatthews.wordpress.com/2007/11/14/coned-the-duke-of-wellington-statue-in-glasgow/\" title=\"\">Duke of Wellington statue always had a traffic cone on its head</a>, Rangers Football Club was comfortably solvent, and Labour ran the magnificent 19th-century city chambers on George Square.</p><p>But now it seems only the first of those can be relied upon. In the former second city of empire an array of once mighty institutions are in varying degrees of crisis. And if Glasgow's voters do decide to turf Labour out of office in the local elections on 3 May, that crisis could extend all the way to Ed Miliband's office.</p><p>It seems ridiculous in some respects to contemplate anyone other than Labour being in charge of the city. A few years ago I was working for the leader of the Scottish National party when the Daily Record (another feature of Glasgow life that has not had its troubles to seek) launched a major campaign against drug dealers. The focal point of the exercise was a march from the city centre to Glasgow Green to which various politicians and others had been summoned, culminating in a rousing speech by the then chancellor, Gordon Brown.</p><p>At the start of the day the small SNP contingent was invited to a reception. Looking round the room we surmised that almost everyone else there had some sort of connection to the Labour party. Its domination of the city seemed set to continue for a long time to come. Indeed, at the following local elections the party secured <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glasgow_City_Council_election,_2007\" title=\"\">71 of the 79 seats on Glasgow City Council</a> (albeit with less than 50% of the vote).</p><p>But such has been the pace of change in Scottish politics that at last year's Holyrood elections the unthinkable happened. The SNP beat Labour in this, the heart of its heartland, taking seats that the nationalists would never have imagined were within its grasp just a few months earlier.</p><p>For the Conservatives (who actually formed a minority administration in the 1970s) and the Liberal Democrats, Glasgow is now a disaster area. In what is a warning for what could be going to happen in other British cities, Nick Clegg's party has virtually disappeared, attracting just 2.5% of the regional list vote last May.</p><p>Equally, the run-up to this May's election could hardly have been worse for the city's ruling Labour group. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-16964356\" title=\"\">budget was passed by just two votes</a> in February amid a wave of resignations and deselections.</p><p>Murky local politics has long been one of the Glasgow stereotypes, but then this has always been a place of contradictory characterisations. Marketers seeking to exploit the legacy of <a href=\"http://designmuseum.org/design/charles-rennie-mackintosh\" title=\"\">Charles Rennie Mackintosh</a> have branded the city <a href=\"http://www.seeglasgow.com/\" title=\"\">\"Glasgow: Scotland with Style\"</a>. On the other hand, it can be used as a prime example of what Kenny MacAskill, the Scottish justice secretary, calls Scotland's <a href=\"http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2011/12/12/knife-carrying-thugs-face-up-to-four-years-in-jail-as-lord-advocate-launches-festive-blitz-on-blades-86908-23629214/\" title=\"\">\"booze and blades culture\"</a>.</p><p>Both views are to some extent borne out in reality. But what's certainly true is that, contrary to the popular egalitarian myth, the city is ferociously unequal. It is sometimes claimed that in Glasgow's West End there are more graduates per head of population than anywhere else in the UK, but at the same time school exam passes in the city are among the poorest in Scotland. Exam results are of course often no more than a measure of family income, and many middle-class parents move out of the city boundaries to what estate agents call \"leafy\" East Renfrewshire or Bearsden.</p><p>But there is also a new form of social exclusion opening up: in a world in which social networking, Googling and online shopping are apparently as natural as getting up in the morning, barely half the population of Glasgow has access to broadband, and a major cause is that a significant number do not even own a computer.</p><p>Despite the claims over schools, childcare and free Wi-Fi that are being  made in the current campaign, it is difficult to see how local councillors, of any party, currently have the power to tackle these wider inequalities.</p><p>Instead, national politics is having a much greater impact on the lives of the city's inhabitants. Seen in that light it seems appropriate that Glasgow's local elections are likely to have major national consequences.</p><p>Losing control of Glasgow would provide yet more ammunition for those who doubt that Ed Miliband is a serious Downing Street contender. Combined with a loss in London's mayoral race, it would almost certainly prompt deliberations over the future of his leadership.</p><p>For the SNP the stakes are high as well. Alex Salmond's opponents are desperate for a slow-down in the nationalists' momentum.</p><p>A good SNP result will mean not just the prospect of badly needed change in the way the city is governed. It will also be pored over by commentators eager to draw conclusions about the implications for the coming independence referendum.</p><p>For Scottish Nationalists (like me) the economic powers of independence are becoming ever more important. It might have been argued that until recently there was an informal contract in Britain whereby Glasgow, and Scotland as a whole, were denied the powers needed to exploit their inherent advantages and in return were compensated with public spending. But George Osborne is now withdrawing that \"compensation\".</p><p>In truth the chancellor's party gave up on the city a long time ago. But for Ed Miliband \u2013 who the SNP gleefully points out in one recent poll is even more unpopular in Scotland than in the UK as a whole \u2013 losing Glasgow would be a historic blow.</p><p>\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/commentisfree\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Scottish+National+party+%28SNP%29&k=Scotland&k=Labour&k=Labour+party+leadership&k=Ed+Miliband&k=Politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=A+Scottish+earthquake+that+could+bury+Ed+Miliband+%7C+Ewan+Crawford+Article+1732166&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=148491&c4=SNP+%28Politics%29%2CScotland+%28News%29%2CLabour%2CLabour+leadership%2CEd+Miliband%2CPolitics%2CEurope+%28News%29%2CUK+news&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Ewan+Crawford&c7=12-Apr-16&c8=1732166&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/2012/apr/16/scottish-earthquake-bury-ed-miliband|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|394b59c952e7d3d3d8d8648a7fe7906b1a06a661 -->",

        "body":"<p>When the history of how a good crisis went to waste gets written up, it will surely contain a big chapter on the failure of our academic elites. Because just like the politicians, the taxpayer-funded intellectuals at our universities have missed the historic opportunities gifted to them by the financial collapse. And it will be the rest of us who pay the price.</p><p>At the start of the banking crisis, the air was thick with the sound of lachrymose economists. How did they miss the biggest crash since 1929? Professors at the LSE were asked that very question by the Queen \u2013 and were too tongue-tied to reply. A better answer came from Alan Greenspan, until recently the most powerful economist on the planet, who went to Capitol Hill and confessed to a \"flaw\" in his model of the world. Clearly, the economic crisis was also a crisis of economics.</p><p>With the all-powerful dismal-ists temporarily discredited, an opportunity opened up for the sociologists, the political scientists and the rest to charge in, have their say \u2013 and change the way public policy is shaped.</p><p>If all that sounds like a battle of the -ologies  to you, then consider: no discipline has so  profoundly shaped Britain or America over the past 30 years as mainstream economics, with its almost unshakeable faith in markets, and its insistence on taking politics out of the public sphere. Displace that narrow, straitened form of economics from its  position as the orthodoxy on modern capitalism, and you have a shot at changing capitalism itself.</p><p>So have the non-economists grasped their  moment? Have they hell. Look at the academic conferences held over the past few weeks, at which the latest and most promising research in each discipline is presented, and it's as if Lehman Brothers never fell over.</p><p>Britain's top political scientists met in Belfast a couple of weeks ago, and you'd have thought there'd be plenty in the crisis for them to discuss, from the technocrat governments installed in southern Europe to the paralysis of British  politicians in the face of the banks. But no: over the course of three days, they held exactly one discussion of Britain's political economy. There was more prominence given to a session on how academic research could advance dons' careers.</p><p>Perhaps you have more faith in the sociologists. Take a peek at the website for the British Sociological Association. Scroll through the <a href=\"http://www.britsoc.co.uk/Media/PressReleases.aspx\" title=\"\"> press-released research</a>, and you will not come across anything that deals with the banking crash. Instead in April 2010, amid the biggest sociological event in decades, the BSA put out a notice titled: \"Older bodybuilders can change young people's view of the over-60s, research says.\"</p><p>Or why not do the experiment I tried this weekend: go to three of the main academic journals in sociology, where the most noteworthy research is collected, and search the abstracts for the terms \"finance\" or \"economy\" or \"markets\" since the start of the last decade.</p><p>Comb through the results for articles dealing with the financial crisis in even the most tangential sense. I found nine in the American Sociological Review, three in Sociology (\"the UK's premier sociology journal\"), and one in the British Journal of Sociology. Look at those numbers, and remember that the BSA has 2,500 members \u2013 yet this is the best they could do.</p><p>Sociologists are reliably good at analysing the fallout from crises: the recessions, the cuts, the dispossessed, the repossessed. I'd expect them to be in for a busy few years. But on the upstream stuff, the causes of this crisis, they are practically silent. At Edinburgh University, Donald MacKenzie has pulled off remarkable close-up studies of financiers in action but without context or politics: the view is all cogs and no car. Indeed, leave aside three remarkable books from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/oct/27/anthropologist-wall-street\" title=\"\">Karen Ho</a>, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jan/09/time-cancel-unpayable-old-debts\" title=\"\">David Graeber</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jan/16/time-control-credit-ratings-agencies\" title=\"\">Alexandra Ouroussoff</a>, all of whom are anthropologists (and all discussed here previously), and the bigger picture is still in the hands of those formerly shamefaced, but now rather assertive, economists. One promising initiative has just begun on the Open Democracy website called <a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/collections/uneconomics\" title=\"\">Uneconomics</a>, where non-economists do chip in on the upstream causes of the crisis. But that's it: a cheap and cheerful  internet forum. The Second International it ain't.</p><p>It wasn't always like this. One way of characterising what has happened in America and Britain over the past three decades is that people at the top have skimmed off increasing amounts of the money made by their corporations and societies. That's a phenomenon well covered by earlier generations of sociologists, whether it's Marx with his study of primitive accumulation, or the American C Wright Mills and his classic The Power Elite, or France's Pierre Bourdieu.</p><p>But those sociologists were public academics, unafraid to stray outside their disciplines. Compare that with the picture of today's teacher in a modern degree-factory, forever churning out publications for their discipline's top-rated journals. Not much scope there to try out a speculative research project that might not fly, or to collaborate with specialists in other subjects.</p><p>Nor is there much encouragement to engage with public life. Because that's what's really missing from the other social sciences. When an entire discipline does what the sociologists did at their conference last week and devotes as much time to <a href=\"http://content.yudu.com/Library/A1w6ig/BSAAnnualConference2/resources/84.htm\" title=\"\">discussing the holistic massage industry</a> (\"using a Foucauldian lens\") as to analysing financiers, they're never going to challenge the dominance of mainstream economics. And it's hard to believe they really want to.</p><p>\u2022 This article was amended on 19 April 2012. The original said Donald MacKenzie is based at Oxford.

        "body":"<p>1. Mauro Demetrio, 21, used his mobile phone to record PC Alex MacFarlane racially abusing him in the back of the van in August last year. MacFarlane, who told the black suspect \"you will always be a nigger\", has been suspended. MacFarlane's colleague PC Joe Harrington and another unidentified officer are accused of assaulting Demetrio. Prosecutors initially decided not to bring charges against any Newham borough police officers, a decision now under review. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating.</p><p></p><p>2. Terelle Ferguson, 16, alleges he was assaulted by PC Harrington at Forest Gate police station on the same night as the alleged racial abuse and assault of Demetrio. Ferguson has since recognised PC MacFarlane from press photographs and alleges he was also involved in the assault. Prosecutors are reviewing advice they gave the IPCC about the possibility of bringing charges. The IPCC is investigating.</p><p></p><p>3. Three other officers at Newham borough \u2013 an acting police sergeant and two PCs \u2013 have been placed on restricted duties after allegedly making racist comments within a group of officers. The incidents are said to have occurred between 6 January and 15 March. A colleague is understood to have reported their comments on 19 March. The IPCC is investigating.</p><p></p><p>4. A seventh Newham borough police officer is under investigation after a complainant \u2013 a 26-year-old man arrested on suspicion of an immigration offence \u2013 came forward on 6 April to say he was racially abused and subjected to excessive force at Forest Gate police station on 24 September. An officer has been placed on restricted duties. The IPCC said it had decided to investigate given the \"nature of the allegations\" against other Newham borough police officers.</p><p></p><p>5. Three police officers in Wandsworth are facing disciplinary proceedings for \"gross misconduct\" over allegations of racist bullying of police community support officers (PCSOs) over an 18-month period. The Met has suspended two of the officers. The force has concluded its internal inquiry and the IPCC said it would wait to see what action the force takes.</p><p></p><p>6. The Met is considering what disciplinary action if any to take against PC Philip Juhasz, 31, who was convicted by a court for telling a Pakistani takeaway manager in north London to \"go back to your fucking country\" after Juhasz was refused discounted food. The IPCC said it was surprised the Met had not referred the case. Juhasz was convicted of a racially aggravated public order offence despite fellow officers vouching for his character. He now faces an internal Met disciplinary panel.</p><p></p><p>7. A female police officer and another female member of staff have been suspended after they were reported using racist language on 26 March. The complaint came from another police officer. The IPCC decided not to investigate, allowing the Met's internal complaints department to handle the case.</p><p></p><p>8. Several police officers in the borough of Wesminster are understood to have made a complaint about another constable \u2013 reportedly a woman \u2013 for allegedly using racist language between May 2010 and August 2011. The accused officer is on restricted duties. The IPCC is not investigating but allowing the Met to handle the case internally.</p><p></p><p>9. The IPCC decided to allow the Met's internal complaints department to handle an allegation that a police constable working for the Central Communication Command mishandled calls. There is a \"racial element\" to the alleged mishandling, which occured over a period in 2010, and the officer has been placed on restricted duties.</p><p></p><p>10. Five police officers in the Met's Territorial Support Group are accused of a racist attack on several children, reportedly after trying to break up a mass water fight in Hyde Park organised on Facebook last summer. All of the officers remain on full duties. The person who made the complaint was recently acquitted of an offence. The IPCC decided to allow the Met to finish the inquiry internally as it was \"close to completion\".</p><p></p><p>11. A member of the public alleged they were racially abused by an unidentified police officer while in Camden borough on 6 January 2012. The case was initially handled internally by the Met, which failed to identify any officer in the vicinity at the time of the alleged incident. Since then, police have identified a patrol car in the vicinity of the complaint, and the IPCC has decided to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Do you have any information about these cases?

        "body":"<p>Barack Obama looks increasingly unlikely to hit the $1bn fundraising target for the November elections despite having raised $53m in March.</p><p>Although the total announced by his campaign team Monday appears impressive, it falls well short of the funds the Democrats were hoping for last year. The Democrats anticipate an advertising onslaught on Obama from conservative Super Pacs supporting the Republican candidate, almost certainly Mitt Romney.</p><p>\"We're all going to have to dig even deeper, work even harder, move even faster,\" said Jim Messina, Obama's campaign manager.</p><p>The $53m brings the total for the first three months of the year to $127m. Adding in the $250m he raised last year, Obama has so far raised $377m.</p><p>To reach the $1bn target, which Democrats are now playing down, Obama would have to raise about $90m each month through to the election. </p><p>Obama's fundraising includes money for his own re-election as well as money he is raising to help Democratic members contesting congressional elections in November. Obama raised $770m in 2008, and he had hoped to outstrip that. </p><p>The campaign announced its March figures ahead of publication by the federal election commission on Friday. Romney has yet to release fundraising figures for March. He has raised $75m since he formally began campaigning last year, but much of this has been eaten up by the battle against his Republican rivals for the party presidential nomination.</p><p>With the exit of Rick Santorum from the race, Romney is now relatively free to focus on the battle with Obama.</p><p>Romney's fundraising so far has been relatively modest compared with Obama's, but the conservative Super Pacs are accummulating vast war chests. Their figures, too, have to be released by Friday. </p><p>The Republican national committee raised $13.7m in March, giving it a war chest of $32.7m.</p><p>Obama's $53m is a big improvement on January, when he took in $29m, and February's $45m. The total for the first three months of the year is less than the $136m he raised in the same period in 2008.</p><p>The Democrats will hope that fundraising will improve as the election comes closer.</p><p>Messina attempted to portray Obama's fundraising as a populist story, funded by lots of small donors rather than a small group of wealthy investors. The Obama campaign said there were 567,000 donors, 190,000 of them donating for the first time. The average donation was $50.78, and 90% of them were $250 or less.</p><p>Messina, in a campaign video announcing the March fundraising figure, said; \"This is really how this works, people building the organisation five to 10 bucks at a time to take on Mitt Romney.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Barack+Obama&k=Mitt+Romney&k=US+elections+2012&k=United+States&k=World+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Obama+raises+%2453m+in+March+but+is+likely+to+miss+%241bn+target+by+November+Article+1732123&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Barack+Obama+%28News%29%2CMitt+Romney+%28News%29%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-16&c8=1732123&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/16/barack-obama-march-fundraising-target|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|7ff72db8c898032e1e5925770944d2fee32cb536 -->",

        "headline":"Google's window of opportunity for its Android tablet is closing fast",
        "body":"<p>The window of opportunity is closing fast for Google to make its presence felt in tablets. It's about to get caught between Apple's iPad and the rapidly approaching Windows 8 - which, on tablets, may offer everything that people need if they don't want an iPad.</p><p>In which case, what's left for Google's Android? (Note the emphasis on Google here, because Amazon's Kindle Fire has shown that non-Google Android tablets can make a splash.)</p><p>We know that Google thinks tablets are important. Here's Larry Page, Google's chief executive, who at last week's earnings discussion was <a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/495351-google-management-discusses-q1-2012-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=qanda\">asked directly by an analyst</a> about the company's presence in the tablet market - one which is expected to grow by about 50% per year over the next few years, and double this year.</p><p><strong>Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division:</strong> </p><blockquote><p>\"I was wondering, Larry, if you could walk us through your view on Google's tablet strategy via Android and the relative importance of having success with these devices in terms of achieving your long-term goal?\"</p></blockquote><p><strong>Larry Page:</strong> </p><blockquote><p>\"Heather, that's a good question. I think that we're very excited about tablets. I think there's a number of Android tablets out there and obviously, we have strong competition there as well. I think you've seen us really invest substantially also in things like Google Play, which really give you great access to entertainment, media, books and videos and so on, and as well as the apps. And we think that's an important component of what we're doing. I think there's also -- obviously, there's been a lot of success on some lower-priced tablets that run Android, maybe not the full Google version of Android. But we definitely believe that there's going to be a lot of success at the lower end of the market as well with lower-priced products that will be very significant. And it's definitely an area we think is important and we're quite focused on.\"</p></blockquote><p>(Thanks to SeekingAlpha for the transcript.)</p><p>The rumours that Google is going to release a low-priced Google-branded tablet, made by Asus, have become pervasive; from the hints apparently dropped by Eric Schmidt (Google's ex-CEO, now chairman) a few months ago, to the murmurs from the manufacturing side, to the stories earlier this month that a <a href=\"http://www.slashgear.com/google-nexus-tablet-july-launch-tipped-after-price-paring-06221825/\">planned launch in May of said tablet has been put off until July</a>.</p><p>In truth, the chance for Android tablets - more particularly, for tablets running Google's Android - to grab a sizable share of the market is shrinking There are three reasons for this: Amazon (and other \"white box\" tablet makers) at the bottom end of the price spectrum; Apple at the top end; and Windows 8 alongside Apple to sweep up all the people who want a tablet for some sort of work but don't want an iPad. </p><p>Gartner's Carolina Milanesi put out a <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1980115\">forecast for the tablet market</a> last week in which she predicted that Apple will continue to dominate the field through to 2016, selling 169m per year by 2016 (compared to just under 40m last year), while Android tablets will ship 137m (compared to 17.3m last year) and Windows 8-based tablets only 43m (in 2011: 0). </p><p>The graph shows how her forecasts have changed since April of 2011: mostly, iPad sales were lower than expected in 2011, and of course WebOS never took off, and QNX (on the PlayBook) turned out to be an anchor instead of a balloon. At the time Microsoft hadn't said anything about Windows 8 and tablets and touch; all it had done was show that the next version of Windows would run on the ARM architecture as well as Intel's. The touch version and Metro didn't appear until the summer.</p><p>But now we know about Metro, and Windows 8. For this year, Milanesi is forecasting 73m iPads, 37.8m Android tablets (including non-Google ones), and just under 5m Windows tablets. Further ahead, she's still seeing good prospects for Android over Windows.</p><p>Now, she's the professional on this (and I respect her opinion a lot), but I beg to differ. While she doesn't distinguish between Google Android (let's call them GAndroid) and non-Google Android tablets (such as the Kindle Fire), it's clear from data given by Andy Rubin, Google's head of Android, that non-Google Android is outselling GAndroid by a substantial margin. </p><h2>Android rising - but which?</h2><p>In October 2011, <a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20111019/andy-rubin-asiad/\">Rubin said</a> (see the 6.52pm slot) that there were about 6m Android tablets using Google services out there. By the end of the year, the proportion of devices accessing the Android Market (as it then was) had risen from 1.8% (around when Rubin spoke) to 2.4%, so allowing for expansion of the Android installed base generally, may have hit 10m.</p><p>Compare that with Milanesi's estimate, of 17.3m Android tablets shipped during 2011, and you start to see the scale of Google's (not necessarily <em>Android's</em>) problem: it's barely dominating its own sector. And when you then compare it to Apple, which Milanesi says shipped just shy of 40m tablets in 2011, or 66% of the total for the year, then you see that Google already has a mass of trouble in this sector.</p><p>But Microsoft is going to make it worse. </p><h2>Reality bites</h2><p>A quick dose of reality first: most owners of Android-powered smartphones, if they have a PC, are Windows users. That's simple statistics: even the most generous assumptions can't push the Mac share among consumers beyond 10%, and as GAndroid smartphones now make up more than half of smartphone sales, and rapidly heading towards being half of the installed base of smartphones too, their users are overwhelmingly going to be Windows users too. Only a tiny pool of people will use an Android-powered phone and a Macintosh. (The other key player in the smartphone market is RIM and its BlackBerry, of course; again, the vast majority there will be running Windows.)</p><p>Apple's small computer share notwithstanding, the iPad has been a tremendous success in the tablet market. That's been helped by the App Store, which has amazing stuff like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/appsblog/2012/mar/29/brian-cox-wonders-ipad-app\">Wonders (the app based on the Brian Cox series</a>; it really is astonishing) as well as access to the iTunes store, so you can download music, TV and films, as well as all those apps that people seem to like. </p><p>And now here comes Windows 8, expected in the autumn (October is the favoured month) and PC and tablet makers are gearing up to offer it. Not only that: Windows 8 on a tablet works really well, even on hardware that wasn't designed for it (see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/apr/13/windows-8-week-tablet-ipad\">Matthew Baxter-Reynolds's experience using the Consumer Preview on an Acer Iconia</a>). And Intel has announced the specifications for forthcoming tablets, and expects there will be about 10 models available - in 10in and 11in versions - by the end of the year.</p><p>Not only that; Microsoft hasn't yet unveiled everything that Windows 8 tablets will have - where you should probably expect some integration, possibly even tight integration, with Xbox Live, and all the content that's available there; the Xbox has become an important conduit for all sorts of conduit, including TV and films, to the living room (arguably more effectively than its own Media Center, and far more so than any other non-TV platform). There will be Xbox integration on Windows 8 tablets, and that's going to mean the chance to play games on them, or watch video, or buy music. </p><h2>Feast of choice</h2><p>So there you are at Christmas 2012. Like many people, you're a Windows user with a Google Android smartphone. (Or perhaps just a featurephone.) You're considering buying a tablet. Here are your choices.</p><p>\u2022 Apple iPad. Doesn't run any Windows software (and it's looking increasingly unlikely that Microsoft will offer any form of Office for it). However it can connect to Google services, which you, as a GAndroid user, are signed up for. Lots of apps, lots of games, lots of content. (If you don't have a smartphone, the apps side won't matter; you don't have any.)</p><p>\u2022 Amazon Kindle Fire. Just a guess, but it's likely Amazon will have this in the UK by the end of the year. Lots of apps and games (through its forked Android market), lots of content that you get with your Amazon ID. No inbuilt apps for your Google services, though you can set up email. (As with the iPad, if you don't have a smartphone, you don't have any existing apps to worry about.)</p><p>\u2022 Windows 8 tablet. Available from a range of makers, with access to your Google services (via email setup and the web, eg for Google Docs), plus Windows compatibility (for things like Office documents, via Office 365 or perhaps directly on the device), plus Xbox content such as games, TV and films that you can sign up for easily - and might already be signed up for. </p><p>\u2022 generic Google Android tablet. Available from a range of makers; price about the same as the iPad, but without the same range of content and apps as Apple, because even if what Eric Schmidt predicted happens and app makers begin targeting Android first on smartphones, in the tablet field Apple still leads, and things like Wonders are still going to get built for the Retina Display iPad and its siblings first. That gives Apple an advantage in the content wars. Google Play does have films and music - but so does Apple, and the price is the same. But the iPad is cheaper, because it's got volume, whereas the top tablet maker in the Android field at the end of 2011 was doing less than a sixth of Apple's volumes. </p><p>\u2022 Google-Asus \"Google tablet\". May be at the same sort of price as Amazon's, but it's hard to believe that it will be comparable, given that it will have been built down to a price, where Amazon can happily sell at break-even, knowing it will profit from selling content. Google (and Asus) have no such guarantee, and the same problems that the generic Google Android tablets face. So it will be cheaper, but won't have the content.</p><h2>Disadvantage Google?</h2><p>Now, the fact that the Google tablet will have the Google brand on it may make a substantial difference for shoppers - the average person will likely see it and think that it's a brand they can trust. (Most people trust Google.) Whether that trust will be sustained once they get it home and find that they <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/search?q=homeland\">can't get Homeland, the TV series</a>. (Then again, it's <a href=\"http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Search?q=homeland#All\">not on Xbox yet</a>, it seems. Apple <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/tv-season/homeland-season-1/id494918009\">does have it</a>. How will things look by Christmas?)</p><p>The key question is, will people be more loyal to their smartphone, or their PC? (If they don't have a smartphone, will that make a difference?) Will they view a tablet purchase as better if it integrates with the former, or the latter? \"Gartner's consumer survey data shows that consumers are running many of their apps on their mobile phones and their tablets,\" the company says. But there's still a huge number of people who don't have tablets, and the fact that so many have chosen to buy iPads, yet have Windows PCs (statistics again), indicates that plenty of people are running different apps on their smartphones and tablets.</p><p>That's why I think that Windows 8 tablets will see a more rapid ramp in sales than Gartner is forecasting. After all, if the argument in favour of Android tablets over the iPad is \"you can plug in an SD card/USB device\", then the Windows tablets will do all that for certain. And if the GAndroid tablets don't have specification tickboxes in their favour, what do they have?</p><p>What could hold Windows 8 on tablets back? Only a couple of things:<br />1) price. With the Windows licence on top of the build price of the tablet, you'll have to expect that they will initially cost more than Android tablets of a similar size. But they might be able to count on volume because of the attractions mentioned above. That could bring price down in short order.</p><p>2) app availability. The Windows 8 (ARM) tablets will have a walled garden app store, just like the iPad does, but it's not yet clear how quick the takeup will be by developers to rewrite apps for it. Although we're told that porting is pretty easy, we were told that too about getting apps onto Windows Phone, and that has hardly set the world alight, despite Microsoft offering money to apps developers. A platform has to be built, and won't grow overnight.</p><p>3) general user experience. Except, as we've already seen, that is already pretty good - and the Windows 8 tablet experience seems miles ahead of the Android experience; the result of Microsoft having spent very much longer on it than Google. </p><p>Overall, then, this is going to be a very tricky time for Google. It now has three challengers in the tablet market: Apple, the leader; Microsoft, the very experienced pretender; non-Google Android makers such as Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble and a zillion Chinese white-box makers; and then, finally, Google itself, and the companies making Google Android tablets. If you had to choose two of those to succeed, which would they be - and why?</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Tablet+computers&k=iPad&k=Android&k=Google&k=Amazon.com&k=Kindle+Fire\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Google%27s+window+of+opportunity+for+its+Android+tablet+is+closing+fast+Article+1732091&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Tablet+computers%2CiPad%2CAndroid+%28technology%29%2CGoogle+%28Technology%29%2CAmazon.com+%28Technology%29%2CKindle+Fire%2CMicrosoft+%28Technology%29%2CWindows+8%2CComputing+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Charles+Arthur&c7=12-Apr-16&c8=1732091&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/blog/2012/apr/16/tablets-ipad-windows-google-android|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|6135e553b3c0d1452df90cf498080ed968f8396c -->",

        "body":"<p>David Cameron will raise the issue of Neil Heywood's murder with senior Chinese officials, as pressure mounts on the Foreign Office to explain what it knew about the British businessman's death.</p><p>The prime minister is likely to discuss the case with Beijing's visiting propaganda chief, Li Changchun, on Tuesday, his spokeswoman said. \"He [Cameron] will welcome the investigation that's ongoing and look forward to seeing the outcome of that,\" she said.</p><p>Li is the first senior Chinese official to visit Britain since it emerged this month that Gu Kailai, the wife of Bo Xilai, one of China's most powerful leaders, is suspected of murdering Heywood.</p><p>In Jakarta last week, Cameron promised British co-operation with the investigation and praised Chinese authorities for their decision to examine the \"disturbing\" case.</p><p>William Hague, the foreign secretary, is under pressure to explain why it took so long for Britain to raise the alarm after Heywood's murder. The businessman was found dead in his hotel room in the south-west city of Chongqing, and consular officials were informed on 16 November. Two months later the FCO asked China to investigate.</p><p>Hague is to give a statement on the case to the House of Commons on Tuesday. He is likely to face accusations that the FCO was slow off the mark because of a reluctance to offend Beijing and damage commercial ties. Several MPs have tabled questions, including the former Europe minister Denis MacShane and the former Liberal Democrat leader Menzies Campbell.</p><p>MacShane said he wanted to know what contacts Heywood had had with British diplomats, both at the consulate in Chongqing and at the Beijing embassy. He said the FCO should make public the information it had received from Wang Lijun, Bo's former chief of police. Wang fled to the US consulate in Chengdu and allegedly told US diplomats in February that Heywood had been poisoned.</p><p>MacShane said the sudden death of a well-connected Old Harrovian would not have reached the foreign secretary's desk but would have been noticed by diplomats in Chongqing. \"When William Hague became foreign secretary, he decided to depoliticise the Foreign Office and turn it into a giant chamber of commerce. He has a pretty mercantalist approach to foreign policy.\" . He said the policy had not worked with China or Russia when British citizens got tangled up with powerful commercial or mafia interests.</p><p>Hague is also likely to face pressure to release cable traffic on Heywood between the British embassy in Beijing and London. \"It's the old question that bedevilled Nixon: what did we know and when did we know it?\" Campbell said.</p><p>He described the case as \"shadowy\" and said the true story of Heywood's murder may never emerge. Heywood had been an adviser for the private intelligence firm Hakluyt, founded by former officials with MI6, although the Foreign Office has discounted claims he was a spy. Campbell asked: \"Was this man in any way part of British intelligence activity?\"</p><p>The affair has already been politically embarrassing for the Foreign Office minister Jeremy Browne, who visited Chongqing on 15-16 November and had dinner with Bo Xilai, at a time when Heywood's body was being cremated without an autopsy.</p><p>Ministers only learned of the suspicious circumstances in February, the FCO said, after members of the British business community raised concerns. MacShane said he had some sympathy with Browne: \"He's a tired minister, arriving tired from London. The worrying thing is that he wasn't properly briefed.\" .</p><p>Browne did not reply to messages asking him to comment.</p><p>\u2022 This article was amended on 17 April 2012. The original described Heywood as an associate with the private intelligence firm Hakluyt. </p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Neil+Heywood&k=UK+news&k=David+Cameron&k=William+Hague&k=Foreign+policy&k=Politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=David+Cameron+to+raise+Neil+Heywood+case+with+visiting+Chinese+official+Article+1732095&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=Neil+Heywood%2CUK+news%2CDavid+Cameron%2CWilliam+Hague%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CBo+Xilai%2CChina+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Luke+Harding&c7=12-Apr-16&c8=1732095&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/16/david-cameron-neil-heywood-chinese|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|df1e68aea0f1c394ac0c513491deec7c106affc4 -->",

        "headline":"Val May obituary",
        "body":"<p>The theatre director Val May, who has died aged 84, was a renowned artistic director of the Bristol Old Vic during a golden era of famous seasons and a series of productions that either toured to Europe or invariably transferred to the West End in London.</p><p>The Old Vic was for many years the most prestigious postwar British rep. May ran the company between 1961 and 1975, harnessing the nearby Little theatre as a forcing house for new talent. In 1972, he supervised a necessary but rather unappealing exterior redesign of the Old Vic's glorious, Georgian, green-and-gold theatre, and founded an instantly successful studio space in its new foyer in King Street.</p><p>May was a rare director, forming a creative bridge between the regional theatre and the West End without ever forsaking one milieu for the other. Tall, civilised, quietly spoken, always sucking on a pipe and sporting a bow tie, he was in many ways \"old school\".</p><p>But at Bristol he also presented the British premiere of Erwin Piscator's great adaptation of Tolstoy's War and Peace, translated by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2004/may/24/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">Robert David MacDonald</a>; the premiere of JB Priestley's adaptation of Iris Murdoch's A Severed Head (1963), which went on to London and New York; and the world premiere, starring Beryl Reid, of Frank Marcus's The Killing of Sister George (1965), a pioneering play about media celebrity and lesbianism that caused a great stir in the West End and on Broadway.</p><p>More conventionally, he co-wrote and directed Portrait of a Queen (1965), starring <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/aug/07/guardianobituaries.lyngardner\" title=\"\">Dorothy Tutin</a> as Queen Victoria, a biographical pageant using many contemporary documents and letters; the play was visited in Bristol by the present Queen before moving successfully to the Vaudeville in London. In 1966, May directed Sixty Thousand Nights to celebrate the Bristol Old Vic's bicentenary.</p><p>His Tribute to a Lady (1975), an affectionate and very funny portrait of Lilian Baylis, manager of Sadler's Wells and the Old Vic in London, was given a special gala performance on the latter stage when the National theatre bade farewell to Waterloo Road. The cast on that memorable occasion included Peggy Ashcroft, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Flora Robson and Albert Finney.</p><p>May was born in Bath, Somerset, the only child of Claude Jocelyn Delabere May, a doctor, and his wife, Olive Gilbert, descended from WS Gilbert, the lyric-writing partner of Arthur Sullivan. The family moved to Guildford, Surrey. By the time he was 12, Val was taking trains to London to see a movie in the morning, a matinee and an evening performance.</p><p>He was educated at Cranleigh school, Surrey, and studied English at Peterhouse, Cambridge, before training at the London Old Vic Theatre School with the influential French director Michel Saint-Denis. After national service with the Royal Navy, he made his London debut directing Cocteau's The Typewriter at the Watergate club theatre in 1950.</p><p>May learned the ropes as an assistant director at the reps in Dundee and Salisbury before being appointed director at the Ipswich theatre in 1953. A four-year spell in Ipswich was followed by a similar term at the old Nottingham Playhouse, a converted cinema, before he went to Bristol.</p><p>May doubled the size of the company in Bristol, produced and directed Barry England's Conduct Unbecoming in 1969 and welcomed Peter O'Toole for a 1973 three-play season in which O'Toole, who had appeared with the company in the mid-1950s, played a scorching Uncle Vanya, a beguiling D'Arcy Tuck in Ben Travers's Plunder and an irresistible King Magnus in Shaw's The Apple Cart.</p><p>One of the Vic's biggest successes was Salad Days (1954) by Julian Slade and Dorothy Reynolds, and the theatre was always trying to find a successor: Fiorello! (1962), an American musical about a New York mayor, fell flat in the West End, while Slade's charming score for Trelawny (1972), an early production of Cameron Mackintosh, seemed to lose something in translation from Bristol.</p><p>That, at least, was the opinion of original cast member Timothy West, who recalled a great piece of direction by May in King Street when Hayley Mills ran on the spot while a row of shops passed across the stage behind her, and a fully dressed Victorian drawing room evaporated piecemeal \"without any apparent human agency\", leaving Ian Richardson singing on a vast empty stage against a blue cyclorama.</p><p>May returned \"home\" to the Yvonne Arnaud, Guildford, which he ran from 1975 to 1992 as a classy West End launching pad. He then directed Shakespeare at the Ludlow festival for three years. His later West End successes included a return to The Apple Cart with O'Toole in 1986 and Richard Harris in Pirandello's Henry IV in 1989.</p><p>His last West End show was Jeffrey Archer's courtroom drama The Accused (2000), in which Archer himself entered the on-stage dock as an alleged murderer and was voted guilty or not guilty by the audience each night. The critics gave a concerted thumbs-down, finding Archer guilty not of murder but of bad writing and even worse acting.</p><p>May was appointed CBE in 1969. He is survived by his daughter Juliet, a television drama director, from his marriage, in 1955, to Penelope Sutton, and by his second wife, Petra Schroeder, whom he married in 1980, and their daughter, Kristina.</p><p>\u2022 Valentine Gilbert Delabere May, theatre director, born 1&nbsp;July 1927; died 6 April 2012</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/stage&k=Theatre&k=West+End&k=Broadway&k=Stage&k=Culture&k=Bristol\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/stage/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/stage/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Val+May+obituary+Article+1732025&ch=Stage&c2=148491&c4=Theatre%2CWest+End%2CBroadway%2CStage%2CCulture%2CBristol+%28News%29%2CUK+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Michael+Coveney&c7=12-Apr-16&c8=1732025&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: stage/2012/apr/16/val-may|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|3cdd561fc6e4ef6f74c90af20023c6c7e23acb73 -->",

        "body":"<p>I'm writing this in the blurry, way-too-early hours of a freezing Monday morning, just before I fly to Crete for my final training camp ahead of the world championships next month. For the next three weeks, everything will become magnified in importance. Diet, training, conditioning, focus \u2013 you name it.</p><p>And with good reason because these world championships, which start on 11 May in Qinhuangdao, China, double up as Olympic qualifiers. The fork in the road is stark. One path, which I'll take by making the quarter-finals or better, gets me a place on the Team GB squad for London 2012. The other leads to, well, in truth I haven't thought about that. Because it's not an option. It can't be. Not now.</p><p>Some people might be fearful of the pressure, but to be honest it drives me. This is my one chance to shine, and I plan to take it. I started boxing when I was 12 years old. Now I'm 29. I want to show all the years of hard work have been worth it.</p><p>I'm doing all the right things \u2013 eating grilled chicken instead of Big Macs, plus getting in lots of vegetables, strawberry whey protein shakes and vitamins to lower the chances of getting ill. I'm also watching YouTube videos of Sugar Ray Leonard and Muhammad Ali, my idols when I was growing up, to see how they boxed when they were amateurs and hopefully learn from them. I want to achieve what they did and win gold in the Olympics.</p><p>Things have been going really well in Sheffield, but a training camp offers something different. At home, I spar with the same fighters \u2013 men and women \u2013 week in, week out (the men obviously hold back on the power and work on skills). So you get used to the punches they throw and the combinations they like to attempt. But in Crete there will be fighters from across the globe, so I will tackle different styles and approaches.</p><p>Such preparation will make a huge difference of course. As does having a performance analyst on the Team GB boxing squad. It's their job to film all the fights we go to, pick up on things we can improve, and maintain a database that tells us the nitty-gritty about every potential opponent, including their wins and losses, whether they box southpaw or orthodox, plus footage of their fights, so we can try to pick up weaknesses.</p><p>Their role will be particularly important in China because the draw for the world championships will only be made once we're out there, so in some cases I might only have 24 hours to prepare for an opponent, which isn't a lot. But that's what it's like in the amateur game \u2013 sometimes I've turned up to a club with no idea whom I'm fighting, but you just have to get on with it!</p><p>Normally when I go away I don't see much beyond the airport, hotel and arena where I fight. But Crete may be different \u2013 I've packed my DVDs (action thrillers and horrors mostly, although my favourite film is Shrek), but I'm hoping also to do some running on the beach and see the odd sight too. But mostly I will training as hard as humanly possible in the run-up to Qinhuangdao. It's quarter-finals or bust, and I don't plan to cash out my Olympic chips just yet.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=Olympics+2012%3A+boxing&k=Olympic+Games+2012&k=Boxing&k=Sport\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Nicola+Adams%3A+I%27m+watching+Ali+and+Sugar+Ray+ahead+of+Olympic+qualifiers+Article+1731964&ch=Sport&c2=148491&c4=Olympics+2012%3A+boxing%2COlympic+Games+2012+olympics+olys%2CBoxing%2CSport&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Nicola+Adams&c7=12-Apr-16&c8=1731964&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/london-2012-olympics-blog/2012/apr/16/nicola-adams-olympic-diary|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|285e9bc86d328c782d6a47913774e4f8eda0ccd5 -->",

        "body":"<p>The police watchdog has announced a review into mounting complaints about racism in the Metropolitan police, warning that they probably suggest a \"much wider disaffection and dissatisfaction\" with the force.</p><p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission also launched two new investigations into alleged racist abuse by Met officers and said it would \"increase its level of scrutiny\" of how Scotland Yard handles complaints about discrimination.</p><p>Senior officials at the IPCC are known to be concerned that the Met may have failed to shake its problem with racism 13 years after it was branded institutionally racist by the Macpherson inquiry set up following the death of Stephen Lawrence.</p><p>The IPCC said it now has <a href=\"http://www.ipcc.gov.uk/news/Pages/pr_160412_MPSreferrals.aspx\" title=\"\">five ongoing investigations</a> into alleged racism at the Met. Six others are being dealt with by the force internally, mainly because the investigations are almost complete.</p><p>The watchdog said its new review would sample old and ongoing complaints about racism to assess whether the Met was dealing appropriately with reports of discrimination.</p><p>All future complaints about alleged racism by Met officers will bypass the force's internal complaints system and be handled by the IPCC, which said this would allow it \"to undertake a thematic review of those cases to identify any trends and learning for the police\", which would then be published.</p><p>The latest controversy over racism in the Met began two weeks ago when the Guardian published a recording in which a constable, Alex MacFarlane, was captured <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/30/police-racism-black-man-abuse\" title=\"\">racially abusing a 21-year-old black suspect</a>, Mauro Demetrio.</p><p>Three days later the Guardian revealed that officers accused of abusing or assaulting Demetrio in the back of a police van also allegedly assaulted a 15-year-old black teenager, Terelle Ferguson, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/05/scotland-yard-allegations-of-racism\" title=\"\">on the same night</a>.</p><p>The Crown Prosecution Service initially advised against bringing charges against the Newham police officers. Senior lawyers at the CPS are urgently reviewing the cases.</p><p>Subsequently it emerged that three other police officers working in Newham, including an acting sergeant, had been place on restricted duties over allegations they made racist comments.</p><p>A week ago the Met commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/03/met-police-commissioner-report-racist-behaviour\" title=\"\">urged his staff</a> to report inappropriate behaviour by colleagues, saying: \"I will not stand for any racism or racists.\" His deputy, Craig Mackey, conducted a review of complaints involving alleged racism and decided to refer seven new cases to the IPCC.</p><p>IPCC commissioner Mike Franklin assessed these new referrals from the Met and decided that one, involving a member of the public who said they were racially abused by a police officer in Camden, would be independently investigated by his team. He was content for the other six cases to be handled by the Met's internal complaints process.</p><p>He said: \"Responsibility for tackling racism in the police and for most complaints about racism by police officers rests squarely with the police, who must demonstrate that they are not being passive and are taking action to root it out. However, in view of these referrals, the IPCC is increasing its level of scrutiny over these cases.</p><p>\"Equally, the police must not hide behind statistics and must recognise that actual recorded allegations of racism are probably an indication of much wider disaffection and dissatisfaction. We know, for example, that young black men who are the most likely to be stopped and searched are also the least likely to use the formal complaints system.\"</p><p>He added: \"At the heart of people's concerns are issues of fairness and respect. The British policing model, which relies on policing by consent, simply cannot deliver a professional service if sections of the population perceive it to be unfair and discriminatory.\"</p><p>The IPCC will also investigate a fourth case involving alleged racism by police in Newham which was not included in the initial batch of referrals. The complainant, who claims to have been racially abused and assaulted in Forest Gate police station last September, only came forward last week.</p><p>There are now 11 separate cases of alleged Met racism under investigation. They involve 20 police officers \u2013 of whom eight have been suspended \u2013 and one civilian staff member. A further seven officers have been placed on restricted duties. Seven of the officers under investigation are based in Newham.</p><p>Franklin added: \"We know that allegations of racism are often difficult to prove as in many cases they are a complainant's word against an officer or officers, but that does not necessarily mean it did not happen.</p><p>\"There needs to an understanding of the complainant's perception of what has happened to them, which is often a product of their experience. The police must see all complaints as evidence of a potential problem, and address the systemic issues underlying the complaints they receive.

        "body":"<p>When Mary Katrantzou sent her models down the catwalk in a liquid sky blue lip during her spring/summer 2012 show this year, it was the one time the huddled throng of hawk-eyed beauty journalists looked away. They did the same at Vivienne Westwood Gold Label, as the models poured down the catwalk with a smattering of violet-blue lipstick. The reason for their disinterest? A statement lip is neither marketable, or, really, publishable. It lacks a certain allure. Blue lips neither mimic a youthful pink flush, nor conjure smoky images of Hollywood siren's pouting through the camera lens. In fact, blue, isn't a colour that says much at all (bar Smurfs and that horrific Eiffel 65 song) \u2013 and what it certainly doesn't say is beautiful.</p><p>But beautiful on whose terms? The glossy magazines that have served our multicultural society so poorly to date, or the advertisers whose idealised beauty sits within such small, immovable margins? Fortunately, it seems the tide is beginning a gradual turn on what's deemed acceptable or beautiful in society, and it's filtering down into the colours we're choosing.</p><p>David Horne, Illamasqua's director of new product development has been in the industry for over 20 years and has seen the change evolve. \"We've seen people wearing our new matte teal lipstick Apocalips on the street and it's becoming a bestseller. Women like Nicki Minaj and Jessie J are setting a new standard for beauty that's borne of experimentation. There's a zeitgeist moment happening now \u2013 people are ready for change. It's the idea of turning yourself inside out and expressing how you feel on the outside with makeup.\"</p><p>Now the stakes have been raised, and it's all in the way you wear it. But don't fear the onslaught of clown-like rainbow shades. The way to wear a statement lip is with nude eyes, a feathering of mascara, perfectly concealed skin with a neat slick of midnight-blue Disciple (<a href=\" illamasqua.com\">£15.50</a>), for example. Paired with a clear gloss it takes on a new shadowy-luxe entity of glassy petrol shine. Barry M's Green 149 (<a href=\"barrym.com\">£4.49</a>) is surprisingly pretty with a peachy eye, whilst Morgana Cryptoria's Absinthe (<a href=\"rowdydow.co.uk\">£8</a>) adds a little turquoise into the mix, with an utterly on trend metallic finish that can be taken to the next level with a little Sleek Molten Metal in Gold Leaf &amp; Pewter (<a href=\"sleekmakeup.com\">£7</a>) daubed in the centre.</p><p>If this all seems like too much effort, too great a risk, or perhaps you're happy with your current hues, you could consider changing the way in which you apply colour. The <a href=\"http://www.fearnobeauty.com/makeup-minded/fear-no-ombre-lips/\" title=\"\">'orchid lip' at Prabal Gurung</a> this season was two shades working in contrast, an inner blackberry flourish in the centre of the lips was beautifully offset by a pink shade around the edges. Or perhaps try an ombre lip, using two similar shades \u2013 like red and hot pink or orange) for subtle effect. But the simplest way to push a colour to the next level is to apply your lip colour, and then pat on a similar shade of pigment like MakeUp Forever's Pure Pigment in Carmine (£11.50, preciousaboutmakeup.com) - I use this on top of M.A.C's Ruby Woo (£13.50, maccosmetics.co.uk) for a pop art red to beat all other reds.</p><p>So finally, my call to arms is this: when we're being sold ideals of perfection, or told what colours we should be wearing this season, look beyond and find the trends not placed at centre stage. While blue lipstick isn't for everyone, a little trial and error with a deeper purple, or a more hi-gloss blackberry is worth the danger.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/fashion&k=Beauty&k=Life+and+style&k=Fashion\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/fashion/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/fashion/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Beauty+for+dark+skin%3A+Lipstick%2C+with+a+difference+Article+1731716&ch=Fashion&c2=148491&c4=Beauty%2CLife+and+style%2CFashion&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Anita+Bhagwandas&c7=12-Apr-16&c8=1731716&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: fashion/fashion-blog/2012/apr/16/blue-lipstick-for-dark-skin|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|a5bdb1417f3aca433acb694ea524bfdb71bab601 -->",

All of which focuses attention on whether there is an inherent flaw in trying to make programmes with global appeal.</p><p>A disaster in its own right or not, though, Titanic is already in handsome profit. Julian Fellowes's £12m drama has been sold to 96 countries, with America's ABC and Germany's ZDF joining early as co-funders. While the drama was entirely shaped in the UK, the main filming took place in Hungary, not Belfast, to save money, with CGI images of the liner added in Canada to take advantage of tax breaks. Could this diverse background and range of investors have undermined the creative vision? Both Stafford-Clark and Vaughan vehemently insist they suffered no editorial interference, even from powerful ABC \u2013 the drama they delivered, they say, was the drama they set out to make.</p><p>The rise of internationally funded programming such as Titanic was the talk of the Mip TV programme market shindig in Cannes earlier this month, where it was seen as vital to match the glossy production values, typical of US studios, that audiences now demand. Another test case is the new series of Doctor Who, which began filming in Cardiff in February, with BBC America again helping to fund it. A taster viewable online shows Matt Smith's Doctor (already seen in the Richard Nixon era White House) caught up in a shootout in a US frontier township. Straddling two continents, however, doesn't seem to reduce its appeal. </p><p>Russell T Davies, who successfully revived Doctor Who, has also seen its adult spin-off, Torchwood, failing to be recommissioned despite being made in Los Angeles and part-funded by the Starz network. \"I know multi-source funding can theoretically compromise,\" he says, \"but then again the BBC hasn't been able to afford its own Dickens adaptations for two decades without [co-funding from the US broadcaster] WGBH, among others, so I think creative work can flourish. It needs a good leader to keep the vision strong.\"</p><p>A senior British TV executive, closely involved in global sales, argues it would be wrong \"to claim Titanic illustrates the weakness of multi-funding. The problem is that the production team was not as good as Gareth Neame and Sally Woodward Gentle at Carnival [producer of Downton Abbey]. All that Titanic demonstrates is that audiences realised it was a turkey and left in droves.\"</p><p>Yet although Downton Abbey is a more traditional production, part-funded by Carnival's US owner NBC Universal, Shirley MacLaine is booked to play the American mother of Lady Cora in series three, adding US appeal.</p><p>Martin Smith, a consultant for the investment group Ingenious Media (which backs series ranging from Zen to Scott &amp; Bailey), confirms there is a shortage of UK funds for TV drama as banks rebuild their balance sheets and broadcasters reduce the amount they put in. The Enterprise Investment scheme, which raised tax relief on loans to 30% a year ago, has helped. </p><p>If there is a pre-sale to a north American broadcaster and other partners, the deal is embraced. But there is always a risk \u2013 Zen, for example, was cancelled when a new BBC1 controller arrived.</p><p>On the other hand, Denmark's public service broadcaster, DR, has demonstrated an alternative route, the power of the \"single vision\", with the success of The Killing and Borgen, which it fully funds, controls, and now exports.</p><p>No one expects Titanic's poor ratings to stifle the trend of  UK drama producers looking overseas for funding. </p><p>The lasting legacy of the Hungary-shot drama may, however, be that it gave George Osborne the stimulus to extend tax credits to TV drama, to try to keep future productions here.</p><p>\u2022 This article was amended on Monday 16 April to correct discrepancies between the print and web versions. The Mip TV programme market took place in Cannes earlier this month, not Mipcom, and WGBH is not a cable network</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/media&k=ITV&k=Television+industry&k=Media&k=Titanic&k=Television&k=Television+%26+radio\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/media/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/media/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Titanic%3A+there+are+lessons+to+be+learned+from+its+early+plunge+Article+1731159&ch=Media&c2=148491&c4=ITV%2CTelevision+industry+%28Media%29%2CMedia%2CTitanic+%28TV+show%29%2CTelevision+%28Culture%29%2CTelevision+and+radio+TV&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Maggie+Brown&c7=12-Apr-15&c8=1731159&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: media/2012/apr/15/ltitanic-lessons-learned-plunge|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|bb5c15ed3606c96ad46ec06ca8c05d738f8d17a9 -->",

        "body":"<p>Heart of Midlothian will face Hibernian in this season's Scottish Cup final, the first time an Edinburgh derby has formed such an occasion since 1896. Without question, this will represent the biggest meeting of Hearts and Hibs in history.</p><p>The dust might just have settled on this incident-packed encounter by the time the final arrives on 19&nbsp;May. A month ago, Celtic were on course for a domestic treble; controversy overshadowed their subsequent League Cup final loss to Kilmarnock, with Neil Lennon again furious here.</p><p>Celtic's manager was rightly aggrieved by the penalty award which led to Hearts' winner. Joe Ledley was punished for a last-minute handball, a ridiculously soft decision which allowed Craig Beattie to score from 12 yards. Celtic believed they should have had a penalty of their own, after the Hearts award, for an Andy Webster handball. In reality, that looked even less of a viable claim than the one from which Beattie profited.</p><p>At full-time, Lennon raced from his technical area to confront the referee Euan Norris, a matter that could trigger disciplinary attention from the Scottish Football Association. Lennon already has three such cases ongoing.</p><p>The Celtic manager opted not to speak after the game  but used his Twitter page to express incredulity. \"Referee told players he thought [Victor] Wanyama handled ... feel so sorry for players and fans .. I think it's personal myself.\"</p><p>His first\u2011team coach, Alan Thompson, expanded on the issue. \"I have seen the incidents three or four times,\" said Thompson. \"If he gives a penalty at one end, he needs to give another. He has to be consistent with it.</p><p>\"There's an inconsistency with how the referee sees it. Yet again we think we've been done in a cup final [sic] from a big decision. In the League Cup final we were denied a stonewall penalty.\"</p><p>Thompson also believed the Hearts midfielder Ian Black was fortunate to stay on the pitch following an early lunge on  Ledley. \"It was a bad one, he has gone over the ball and over the top. Ledley is lucky he got away with it.\"</p><p>There had been no hint of impending drama during a mundane opening half. Stephen Elliott missed a Hearts chance within 30 seconds of the kick-off, with Celtic's Ki Sung-yueng rattling the goal frame with a 45th-minute header.</p><p>Hearts took the lead two minutes after the restart. Beattie, who excelled after appearing as a substitute, played in Rudi Skacel. The Czech midfielder further endorsed his hero status among the Hearts following with a finish into the roof of Fraser Forster's net.</p><p>Celtic had been wasteful in their attempts at mustering a response but Gary Hooper ensured exactly that \u2013 albeit seemingly from an offside position \u2013 when meeting Charlie Mulgrew's cross with his&nbsp;head. Norris pointed straight to the spot after Ledley blocked a Marius Zaliukas shot at close-range. Beattie, a former Celtic player, wounded his former employers in calm fashion. Ledley volleyed Celtic's best stoppage\u2011time opportunity straight at the Hearts goalkeeper Jamie MacDonald, who enjoyed a fine afternoon.</p><p>\"For me, playing Hibs is the same as playing any other teams,\" said the Hearts manager, Paulo Sergio. He should try telling that to his club's supporters. Edinburgh is already in the grip of fevered&nbsp;anticipation.</p><p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Craig Beattie (Hearts)</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/football&k=Scottish+Cup+2011-12&k=Celtic&k=Hearts&k=Scottish+Cup&k=Football&k=Sport\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/football/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/football/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Celtic+1-2+Hearts+%7C+Scottish+Cup+semi-final+match+report+Article+1731548&ch=Football&c2=148491&c4=Scottish+Cup+2011-12%2CCeltic+%28Football+club%29%2CHearts+%28Football+club%29%2CScottish+Cup%2CFootball%2CSport&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Ewan+Murray+at+Hampden+Park&c7=12-Apr-15&c8=1731548&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: football/2012/apr/15/celtic-hearts-scottish-cup|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|4255313e0a0d513bf478bd634cfb3ce75ba97a82 -->",

        "headline":"National Youth Orchestra of&nbsp;Great Britain; St John Passion/Polyphony; Rigoletto \u2013 review",
        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nyo.org.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>National Youth Orchestra</strong></a>'s April concert began with a 170-person-strong sneeze and ended with a ceilidh. In between there were shanties, folk songs, marches, hornpipes and folk fiddlers; a crazed revamp of the national anthem, a few snatches of improvisation and a cluster of specially written premieres. This is the NYO as most of us have never seen it. These young musicians did not wave their shirts or wriggle into or out of them, Venezuelan-style. In fact they made no attempt to pretend they were Latin American, which was a big relief. As the conductor, <a href=\"http://charleshazlewood.com/\" title=\"\">Charles Hazlewood</a>, observed rather sharply, this is a British orchestra with its own remarkable, indeed brilliant, standards and traditions going back to 1948. Let's celebrate them, he commanded, warning us that we need to fight for proper music provision in schools for those coming after.</p><p>For four years now, the orchestra's spring session has been held at the Sage, Gateshead. Each occasion has been more pioneering than the last, a chance for these gifted 13- to 19-year-olds to expand their musical horizons as befits a changing musical world. Playing Bruckner is not enough. This year, especially appropriate to the north-east and to the Sage in particular, with its strong community links, the theme was folk music: chiefly British but with a touch of Hungarian, French and Mexican tossed in. Apart from the last, a wishy-washy Aztec number by Carlos Chávez which I would have tossed out, the programme was varied and challenging.</p><p>That sneeze, erupting through the entire orchestra, came courtesy of Kodály's <em>Háry János</em> Suite, the six movements of which were threaded through the evening. According to Hungarian tradition, a story told after such a nasal expulsion is true, which is useful since János's tales are particularly fantastical. The orchestral writing is witty and colourful, with ear-catching solos for cimbalom and viola, excellently played. Four premieres by <a href=\"http://www.patricknunn.com/\" title=\"\">Patrick Nunn</a> (b 1969) incorporated folk tunes and traditional methods such as call and response, and culminated in the rousing <em>Bardstorming</em>, which ended with everyone leaping to their feet. Throughout, the NYO was joined by members of the folk band <a href=\"http://www.bellowhead.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Bellowhead</a>. If you'd told me I might enjoy this I would have guffawed. But I did.</p><p>The Sage commissioned a new NYO piece by <a href=\"http://www.kathryntickell.com/home/\" title=\"\">Kathryn Tickell</a>: a lilting, melodic<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgAlspxpzpg&amp;feature=player_embedded#!\" title=\"\"><em> Northumbrian Fantasia</em></a>. She had taught the string section how to bow a jig so that it sounded fiddlingly authentic, not like a passage of semi-quaver string crossing by Handel. The exuberant Irish soprano <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnUK9Y2g-sU\" title=\"\">Ailish Tynan</a> had everyone chuckling when she introduced three of Canteloube's <em>Songs of the Auvergne.</em> The ripe orchestration, she said, was like Hollywood in 3D, the French dialect as baffling as anything heard in a Glasgow taxi or a Dublin pub. She has perfect comic timing as well as a stunning voice. <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/jamesmacmillanmusic\" title=\"\">James MacMillan</a>'s <em>Britannia </em>(1994), a&nbsp;bravura showpiece, exploited the full orchestral resources, a vast quilt of&nbsp;musical snippets from these isles. The concert was repeated in London last night. Next up: Messiaen's <em>Turangalîla </em>in August.</p><p>Stephen Layton has forged his own, near folkloric tradition by conducting his elite choir, <a href=\"http://www.polyphony.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Polyphony</a>, in Bach's <strong>St John Passion</strong> every year on Good Friday for at least a decade. Yet nothing about their performance is habitual: the renewal of the choir or a change of soloists ignites each performance anew. This year's was a solemn joy. A scaled-down Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment were a notch below their usual excellence but are incapable of playing badly. As the Evangelist, <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/ianbostridge\" title=\"\">Ian Bostridge</a> probed deeper than ever into his vital narrative.</p><p>His prolonged ornamentation on the words \"und weinte bitterlich\" (\"and wept bitterly\") conveyed a terrible dolour, close to wailing while still being perfect in its vocal control. <a href=\"http://www.iestyndavies.com/\" title=\"\">Iestyn Davies</a>, now in the stratosphere of top young international countertenors, sang \"Es ist vollbracht\" with a purity that held the entire audience stock still, moved but unmoving. Roderick Williams (bass/Pilate) brought vigorous intensity to each utterance, with Polyphony's interjections urgent, alert and immaculately shaded. Most of these forces are recording the work for release on Hyperion next year: I am impatient.</p><p>The appetite for cinema broadcasts of concerts and opera appears insatiable, for good reason. This hybrid is affordable and communal. Tomorrow and Thursday, seven venues are showing Gustavo Dudamel conduct the LA Phil, the Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra and assorted choirs in Mahler's <em>Symphony of a Thousand</em>, the climax of their<a href=\"http://www.laphil.com/tickets/mahler/index.cfm\" title=\"\"> Mahler Project</a>, with at least that number performing instead of the usual measly 500. Sold as <a href=\"http://www.laphil.com/laphillive/\" title=\"\">LA Phil Live</a>, it's certainly true that the musicians were alive when they performed it, though in fact it was filmed in Caracas in February.</p><p>On Tuesday, however, the Royal Opera House really is live: <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/whatson/production.aspx?pid=18139\" title=\"\"><strong>Rigoletto</strong></a> <a href=\"http://cinema.roh.org.uk/\" title=\"\">will be relayed to 600 cinemas in 21 countries</a>. This revival of David McVicar's dark, period-costume production is enticingly conducted by John Eliot Gardiner with gleaming, detailed playing from the ROH orchestra. Designed by Michael Vale, it takes place in a revolving structure with a canted facade, first sack-covered shack then glinting silver ducal palace. It's clever but cumbersome and may work far better on the big screen.</p><p>One draw is that ultimate smouldering \"popera\" star <a href=\"http://www.vittoriogrigolo.com/uk\" title=\"\">Vittorio Grigolo</a>, playing the Duke, who struts and bulges physically and vocally, as if he alone doesn't understand the words, which is odd considering that he, like Verdi and like the language of the text, is Italian. This is a show-off part and he shows off and some. Unless he is to be typecast he will have to fine-tune his technique (and some). <a href=\"http://www.askonasholt.co.uk/artists/singers/soprano/lucy-crowe\" title=\"\">Lucy Crowe</a>, already singing some performances in the run, was a late replacement for Ekaterina Siurina as Gilda. Busy rehearsing the title role in <em>The Cunning Little Vixen </em>at Glyndebourne, Crowe has a tender manner but sounded weary vocally, perhaps still mentally caught up in Janácek's wholly different musical landscape. Matthew Rose shone in the murky role of Sparafucile, with Christine Rice as his sister Maddalena on sultry form.</p><p>In the title role and making his ROH debut, the Greek baritone <a href=\"http://www.apaartistsmanagement.com/dimitriplatanias.html\" title=\"\">Dimitri Platanias</a> climbed convincingly into the hunchback's ugly, insect-like shell and reminded us that this grotesque figure above all engenders sympathy, though few but his adoring daughter and her late mother \u2013 both described as angels \u2013 have spotted his elusive charms.</p><p>Today, Victor Hugo's malformed jester might have featured on Channel&nbsp;4's schlocky new compassion-reality series <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-undateables\" title=\"\"><em>The Undateables</em></a>. More than a century and a half ago, he inspired one of Verdi's most faultless and compact masterpieces. Get to a cinema near you. Since there are 165 showing it in the UK, there's no excuse \u2013 unless you live offshore, fast becoming the natural habitat of the few people left in the world who can still afford the stalls at Covent Garden.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/music&k=Classical+music&k=Music&k=Culture&k=JS+Bach&k=Giuseppe+Verdi&k=Gustavo+Dudamel\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=National+Youth+Orchestra+of%26nbsp%3BGreat+Britain%3B+St+John+Passion%2FPolyphony%3B+Rigoletto+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1731336&ch=Music&c2=148491&c4=Classical+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture%2CBach+JS+Bach%2CVerdi+Giuseppe+Verdi%2CDudamel+Gustavo+Dudamel%2CBellowhead&c3=The+Observer&c6=Fiona+Maddocks&c7=12-Apr-14&c8=1731336&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2012/apr/15/nyo-sage-polyphony-rigoletto-review|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|e8b626b17544c8c102e6a9b72832b9a85a89299e -->",

        "headline":"If you've lost the philatelists, your days are surely numbered",
        "body":"<p>The beleaguered Royal Mail is losing the last of its natural allies: stamp collectors. John Baron, chairman of the <a href=\"http://www.abps.org.uk/Home/index.xalter\" title=\"\">Association of British Philatelic Societies</a>, said it had \"killed the market\" while Alec MacGuire, a collector from Surrey, thinks it's \"making Britain a laughing stock of the philatelic world\". When you get this sort of response to a series of stamps depicting picturesque British landmarks, you know you've lost your touch.</p><p>So what is the philatelists' complaint? Cumulative adhesive poisoning? Respiratory problems caused by repeated sneeze-suppression? Hinge-licker's tongue? In this case, no. They're angry that the Mail (Royal, not Daily \u2013 although, since the abolition of the second post, it is only daily) is issuing too many new stamps. It would beggar most collectors to keep up. They're cynical about the motives: \"Doubtless once the privatisation process has gone ahead, the number of issues will increase still further,\" the <a href=\"http://www.gbps.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Great Britain Philatelic Society</a>'s website administrator responded drily (that's hinge-licker's tongue for you).</p><p>But who is going to want to buy Royal Mail now? The manifest desperation of its current owner to sell isn't much of a draw. All recent governments have seemed keen to flog it, very much as if there'd been any kind of public clamour for this to happen. We live in the era of determinedly selling public assets and then carrying on as if the consequences aren't annoying \u2013 as if we haven't just endured a sodden Easter weekend with months of hosepipe ban ahead and no one at whom to scream \"Why didn't you dig more sodding reservoirs, you incompetent scum?!\", other than various consortia of international investors. There's no government department to blame for the shortage. No feeling that the cash saved by failing to improve the infrastructure is at least money the British public has retained rather than economies made at our collective expense by unaccountable strangers.</p><p>As if the choice of electricity and gas suppliers that we currently enjoy were an inviting menu rather than two depressing options: waste your time or waste your money. An unappetising prospect imposed on us to sustain the free market ideology of a dying 90s Tory government and perpetuated by its New Labour successors out of fear of looking like enemies of commerce if they did anything too sensible.</p><p>As if the railways aren't more over-priced and ineptly run than under British Rail but with the added irritation of each line having a different logo and platitudinous slogan plastered all over the filthy, outdated, sluggish rolling stock \u2013 a desecration more indecent than the filthiest graffito. First Great Western is the most infuriating because it both makes the spurious claim of being first and deliberately echoes the name of the company which actually <em>was </em>first in that region: the Great Western Railway, Brunel's firm which built the line. Companies like First Great Western are so far from making that kind of contribution to the transport network that they can't even understand how offensive it is to make the comparison. It's like an illiterate Anglo-Saxon chieftain using a derelict Roman temple as a shelter for shitting and then crowning himself emperor in honour of the achievement.</p><p>But who, even among the rapacious and amoral forces of international finance that the government is so keen to harness to build schools and hospitals, is going to want Royal Mail? It would be such a depressing thing to buy. Once mighty, reliable, profitable, it now struggles to make ends meet providing a vastly inferior service to a shrinking pool of customers amid price rises almost as far ahead of inflation as email is quicker than the post. We should have known trouble was coming in 2001 when it spent £2m changing its name to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/oct/16/brands-consigned-to-the-dustbin\" title=\"\">Consignia</a> for 16 months. We hoped it was just a midlife crisis but in fact it was the onset of dementia. This is clearly not an institution with the mental health to confront the digital revolution with fortitude.</p><p>Not that over-supplying the market with novelty stamps is the worst of its failings. If it can make a fast buck out of people who collect stamps which prolongs its ability to employ people who collect letters, then fine. Then again, if it goes too far, that source of income could be eradicated (pun carefully avoided), which would be an even stupider mistake than a name-change to Letterinterceptatron Inc because, as John Baron points out, it's a financial win-win for Royal Mail when a collector buys a stamp as \"They don't have to deliver the letter\".</p><p>I suppose someone will buy Royal Mail eventually. You can sell anything for the right price thanks to the internet \u2013 it's the perfect tool for bringing buyers and sellers together, which is why it must pose such a threat to collecting as a hobby. Gone are the days of scouring obscure philatelic fairs to improve your collection of 1920s Belgian stamps. Now you can just put your requirements into Google and, for the right price, purchase what was once a lifetime's painstaking collecting in a click.</p><p>Some say that collecting things is pointless and dull: the trainspotter is as universally accepted a cliche of mockery as the jobsworth is of annoyance. We imagine that trainspotting is what jobsworths do in their time off, rather than something zeitgeistier like tai chi or anal bleaching. But I can understand the appeal of arbitrarily picking something to look for and care about in this bewildering world \u2013 of taking pleasure in creating a bit of order amid the chaos. It's a shame if the internet spoils that by making it too easy and driven by money rather than dedication.</p><p>Maybe collectors need to go back to base principles: to collecting things, like train numbers, that are of no monetary value, purely for the joy of completeness. The stamp game is up \u2013 it was up long before the internet, before Royal Mail started over-issuing \u2013 it was up when the first stamps were issued with collectors in mind. Its purity as a hobby came from people eccentrically deciding to treasure those functional little stickers for showing that postage had been paid \u2013 to turn them into objects of desire, purely out of a need to lavish something with attention, like a bewildered gorilla mistaking a Barbie for its dead cub.</p><p>Royal Mail's enticing new stamps, with their attractive pictures of York Minster and the white cliffs of Dover, are just a prostitute's wiles: desperately extorting cash by exploiting people's need to love. And it'll only inject it straight in its parcel delivery arm.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Royal+Mail&k=Business&k=Postal+service&k=UK+news&k=Stamps&k=Design\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=If+you%27ve+lost+the+philatelists%2C+your+days+are+surely+numbered+%7C+David+Mitchell+Article+1730722&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=148491&c4=Royal+Mail+%28News%29%2CBusiness%2CPostal+service%2CUK+news%2CStamps+%28Art+and+design%29%2CDesign+%28Art+and+design%29%2CArt+and+design&c3=The+Observer&c6=David+Mitchell&c7=12-Apr-14&c8=1730722&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/2012/apr/15/david-mitchell-royal-mail-stamps|2012-04-20T09:42:55Z|428893bce6a5e2689d651a37930eab2584a90adc -->",

        "body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">Preamble:</span> We're no strangers to glamour here at the Guardian US (I once saw someone who looked like Heidi Klum getting out of a cab, though it might have been Steven Lenhart, and it might have been a yellow card\u2026). So it was with an air of jaded recognition that we flicked through the collection of old media we stack the laptop on for game days and noted that a khaki-suited Peter Nowak had this week been announced as the coach of the MLS All Stars - who are in turn lined up to play the stars of Chelsea in this year's MLS showpiece event in Philadelphia. </p><p>Novak may have been happy with the distraction of the All Star announcement this week \u2013 and the distraction of the announcement of a friendly game for the Union against Schalke in May \u2013 and possibly the distraction of pointing randomly out of the window at the press conference and yelling \"Look! A seagull!\"\u2026 Anything to distract from the fact that the Union have a solitary point from their opening fixtures; that the focus of their attack (LeToux) has gone and not yet been convincingly replaced; and that rather than his squad returning refreshed from a break week, he has lost a rare creative spark, Roger Torres, for 10 weeks, with a knee injury picked up in a reserve game on Monday night. </p><p>Judging by some of the increasingly dissatisfied noises coming from the River End, Philadelphia's fans are unlikely to be distracted by the European names turning up in Chester, as they are focused on their own team's MLS shortcomings, following a promising sophomore season last year. Nowak has been the focus of their dissatisfaction \u2013 never yet fielding the same team, playing players out of position, butting heads with captain Danny Califf, and generally reacting to adversity with the single-minded cussedness that endears individuals to Philly crowds in the good times, and makes an easy target in bad ones.</p><p>Robert Warzycha is probably forwarding the All Star announcement himself given the visiting Columbus Crew's recent fortunes. He'd certainly like to distract attention from last week's 4-1 home defeat by New York and in particular from the bullying his center backs endured from Henry and Cooper (the latter a man whose own coach described him as \"too nice\"). They'll need to be more resilient today, though arguably the Crew's greatest hope is for the game to be relocated to Canada at the last minute \u2013 they're 100% against Canadian opposition so far this year and 0% v American opposition\u2026</p><p>Either way, we're ignoring the claims of Kansas and RSL, and the battle of the free scorers between New York and San Jose and declaring this to be the MLS glamour tie of the weekend. NBC agree with us \u2013 and when the network that brought you the style icon that is Jay Leno speaks, the nation's fashionistas (including the nylon clad disaster that is the Guardian US sport corps) listen. So The Union v The Crew it is - brought to you by the <strong>Official Guardian MLS Week 6 Meme™: Glamour</strong>.</p><p>I'll be back shortly with team news. Tweet your thoughts, rants and top ten fashion no-no's for the Sons of Ben to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/KidWeil\">@KidWeil</a>, or email <a href=\"mailto:GuardianUSSportslive@gmail.com\">GuardianUSSportslive@gmail.com</a> with longer form thoughts on stats in the final third and just what the well-dressed Nordecke fan should be matching with bright Yellow this season.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">More Glamour / team news:</span> Continuing with the <strong>Official Guardian MLS Week 6 Meme™: Glamour</strong>, some time Philly Guardian commenter Scott Kessler, from the Brotherly Game blog, tweeted the news this week that \"Freddy Adu is one of 19 MLS players featured in a Cosmopolitan piece on \"Hot Soccer Players We Can't Resist\" in the magazine's Hot Guys section online.\" Adu has been carrying the \"one-time teenage prodigy\" tag for around 47 years now, so the news that he has reached maturity and acquired a new in-no-way-burdensome tag in time for his 83rd birthday may be just the boost Philadelphia needs today. </p><p>Team news:</p><p><strong>Philadelphia:</strong><br />MacMath; Williams, Califf, Valdes, G. Farfan; Daniel, Gomez, Carroll, M. Farfan; Hot Soccer Player We Can't Resist, Pajoy</p><p><strong>Columbus:</strong><br />Gruenebaum, Miranda, Marshall, Gehrig, Francis; Urso, Mirosevic, Gaven, Finlay; Vargas, Schoenfeld</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">Team thoughts:</span> So Adu does indeed come into the side, though by the look of it, in a more advanced position than expected, alongside Pajoy. Can he be the key for Philadelphia rediscovering goalscoring form? For Columbus, Finlay comes into the midfield for Anor, after being one of the few bright spots of last week's loss to New York. No room for Renteria, though - the 6'4\" rookie Aaron Schoenfeld gets a start up front alongside Vargas \u2013 Califf and Valdes might have their hands full this afternoon.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">Grind:</span> Of course any self-respecting rock star whose second album is all about the rigors of touring, will tell you that glamour is often just a mask for unremitting grind. So spare a thought for the hardcore members of the Columbus Crew supporter's group Crew Union, <a href=\"http://instagr.am/p/JZGAfjrvCe/\">here seen</a> getting ready to set off with hope in their hearts etc at an ungodly hour this morning, before being <a href=\"http://ow.ly/i/z6Gq\">stopped in their tracks almost immediately</a> by a bird hitting the windscreen of their coach - presumably some kind of kamikaze Canada Goose taking revenge for the points the Crew have plundered from their friends in the North, in their patriotic attempt to do no wrong by their fellow Americans\u2026</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">Late team news:</span> Union captain Danny Califf is out with an injury picked up in the warm up. Rookie Raymon Gaddis is forced into the line up at the last moment. Nowak can't catch a break right now...</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">First Tweet:</span> Graham Randall (@76placidcasual), who may or may not actually be Peter Nowak, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/76placidcasual/status/191246327458447360\">tweets to thank me</a> for providing a link to this page:</p><p>\"@KidWeil much obliged #sackwarzycha\"</p><p>Anthem being sung with much gusto by Philly faithful.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">Pre-game ads:</span> Great products. Impossibly hospitable world where feeds never crash and gorgeous looking people all support Barcelona etc. </p><p>Now we're back with Arlo White - a man synonymous with glamour, and Kyle Martino - a man synonymous with headsets. Almost kick off...</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">PEEP!:</span> And we're off. Ball pinballing all over midfield from the start. Early clash of heads between Finlay and Gabriel Farfan and a pause in play.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2 mins:</span> Players still down being treated - Philadelphia do not need further strain on their defense. Farfan walks groggily off.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4 mins:</span> Nowak chewing furiously on sidelines as Farfan is patched up - and we're off again. Way overhit ball forward by Valdes and Columbus regain possession.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">5 mins:</span> Last update could possibly have been more elegantly expressed... Columbus win a corner off Farfan...</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">6 mins:</span> ...ricochets around in the box before being rushed clear. Columbus pressing early though no clear shape yet.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">7 mins:</span> Now the Union have a corner. Adu to take it...</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">8 mins:</span> ...deep left footed corner evades everyone. Philadelphia keep possession then Pajoy makes a neat flick to set Adu free, but he has strayed offside.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">9 mins:</span> Still <strong>0-0</strong> and no shots on goal yet. Game yet to get going. Gomez lofts a nice lob forward to set Pajoy one-on-one with Marshall, but he can't quite control it. Good intent from the Union though.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11 mins:</span> Philadelphia getting a little joy from turnovers - looking marginally sharper in midfield and picking up on some Columbus errors.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12 mins:</span> Adu tries to get moving down the left but is blocked. A Marshall header lands at Carroll's feet 25 yards out and he tries a shot - but it's well wide.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">13 mins:</span> Game inching deeper into Columbus territory now. Daniel looking lively for the Union and the players around him looking better in possession than the Crew.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">15 mins:</span> Of course, as soon as I say that Columbus attack and Finlay cuts a dangerous looking ball back into the area. Cleared for a throw.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">16 mins:</span> Carroll intercepts a Gaven run and releases Daniel up the right. His pass forward is met by Pajoy who's playing hold-up man well. He wins a corner...</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">17 mins:</span> ...Adu hits the corner straight into the hands of Gruenebaum. Columbus get it forward but Philadelphia regain possession.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">18 mins:</span> Union pressure now and they win another corner as Adu hustles Gehrig off the ball in the box before a cross hits the hand of Francis for a half-hearted penalty appeal. The corner is wasted but Columbus would like a spell of possession now. Still <strong>0-0</strong>.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">19 mins:</span> They're showing the penalty appeal again. Francis did have his hand up and it looks a little more legitimate as a possible offense on second viewing.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">21 mins:</span> From doing the harrying themselves in the opening few minutes, Crew are definitely being outfought by the Union right now. But as Arlo White points out, Philadelphia have only played with a goal lead for three minutes this season (at Portland) and now they've conceded a dangerous free kick...</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">22 mins:</span> CHANCE!...it falls to Schoenfeld's feet six yards out but he can't get his shot off and the ball is scrambled clear. A warning for the Union.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">24 mins:</span> Now Columbus are inching forward, but Farfan, who's showing no ill-effects from his earlier knock, makes a great tackle to cut out the threat.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">25 mins:</span> Gomez picks up a stupid yellow for kicking the ball away after a nothing free kick.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">26 mins:</span> After calling it a nothing free kick it actually arrives as a free header for Vargas in the box, but he can't get it on target. Union fans are singing \"You're not singing over there\", which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/apr/14/mls-philadelphia-union-vs-columbus-crew-live#block-4\">under the circumstances</a> seems a little cruel...</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">28 mins:</span> Neat turn by Farfan feeds Adu, but his move is cut out. Gomez tries to get going down the right, but nothing doing. Getting a little untidy again.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">30 mins:</span> Adu wriggling again on the left and he fires a harmless enough looking cross towards the near post, which Gehrig nearly turns into a harmful one by nudging just past his own post. Adu has another chance with the corner, but Williams wild header meets him back near the flag.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">32 mins:</span> The giant Marshall goes down after a clash of heads during that corner. Crew are very shorthanded in that position. Not a welcome sight for them.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">33 mins:</span> Columbus pumping the ball long looking for a knock down from the giant Schoenfeld, but Williams is there with a better header than he managed at the corner a moment or so ago.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">34 mins:</span> Teasing Columbus cross just evades Schoenfeld.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">36 mins:</span> Columbus trying to string some passes together now, but the ball drifts out. Now Adu has the ball on the left for the Union. He drives the ball in and <strong>PENALTY!</strong></p><!-- Block 35 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">GOAL!:</span> <strong>Gomez! Philadelphia 1 Columbus 0</strong> Cheeky Panenka from Gomez and Union lead.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">39 mins:</span> Gehrig gave the penalty away with an awkwardly extended arm from Adu's cross. Very few attempts on goal from the Union and a set piece was beginning to look like their best way through. Very cool finish from Gomez and a good time to score.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">41 mins:</span> Schoenfeld plays a beautiful through ball for Finlay as the Crew try to recover, but Williams cuts it out. From the throw Vargas has a header which Williams has to clear sharply near the line. The Union will be glad to get to half time.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">43 mins:</span> There'll be a few minutes added on for that delay near the start, but Nowak, who actually looked like he was suppressing a grin in the wake of that goal, would give anything for the whistle to go now.  Corner for Columbus...</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">44 mins:</span> Ball flicked on dangerously by a Philly defender, but Gehrig's cross back drifts out for a goal kick.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">45 mins:</span> Mirosevic lays a sweet ball into the path of Francis, who feeds Vargas in the box. He can't get a clean shot, but they're beginning to make more connections now. 3 minutes to be added on.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">45 +1 mins:</span> Deep free kick headed back dangerously across Philly box by Chad Marshall. Hacked clear, but the Crew have responded in a lively manner to going behind.</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">45 +3mins:</span> Ball knocked forward to relieve pressure almost releases Pajoy, who rolls of Gehrig. Crew come forward again. Vargas caught by Brian Carroll, who picks up a yellow card eventually, after the advantage breaks down.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">45 + 5 mins:</span> Delay whilst Vargas is treated. He hobbles off and that's the last action of the first half. <strong>Half time: Philadelphia 1 Columbus 0</strong>. Half time thoughts in a moment.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">Half-time thoughts:</span> Well as glamour ties go, it's an honest to goodness midfield scrap for the most part. Kyle Martino interviews Robert Warzycha pitch side as the players file off, and he says pretty much the same. </p><p>Philadelphia were more or less good value for the lead - trying to get forward and with Daniel in particular looking lively. Hot Soccer Player We Can't Resist tried a few darts and eventually got the reward when his cross hit Gehrig for the penalty. Gomez's penalty was very audacious - not least for coming in front of a beleaguered Philadelphia crowd whose patience has been tested by recent events. If he'd missed there'd have been hell to pay.</p><p>As it was, the Union were able to see out the half, though not without some scares. Vargas just overhit a sweet curled cross for Schoenfeld, who also had the ball at his feet just a few yards out - they'll have chances in the second half.</p><p>All set up for the second half then.</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">Memewatch:</span> Kyle Martino is modeling the All Star game jersey over the top of his shirt and tie combo. A fly fashion risk, as the Beastie Boys would say.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">Half time emails:</span> Another terse missive from a Columbus fan. Jim Bach writes in to state:</p><p>\"It is baffling to me how a coach as incompetent as Warzycha still has a job in this league.\"</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">More on that All Star honor:</span> As honors go, All Star Coach is a slightly thankless task \u2013 unlike the inter-divisional showcase games in other American sports, the preferred MLS format tends to match the best performing MLS stars against a hand-picked European team, with the MLS players generally having a couple of short practices to get to know each other beforehand. So for the designated MLS coach there's an argument that it's largely an exercise in photo shoots, garden variety 4-4-2, political substitutions (on a par with those made by an under-8's coach in a densely populated neighborhood of competitive parents), and a stoical \"the-real-business-comes-at-Toronto-next-week\" fixed grimace as the 5th goal goes in. </p><p>Though before that penalty went in Peter Nowak may have been reflecting that being a Philadelphia Union coach is a slightly thankless task too...</p><p>Anyway we're nearly starting again...</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">46 mins:</span> PEEP! And we're off again. Instantly Columbus try to get forward, pushing the ball round the wings looking for the angle for a cross. Now they have a free kick in the Union half...</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">48 mins:</span> Nothing comes of it. Now it's a Union kick just inside the Crew half...</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">49 mins:</span> <del>GOLAZO</del> Close! Farfan wriggles through the Columbus defense but his final shot is just wide. Great skill though. The resulting corner is cleared, but that's the liveliest Farfan has looked.</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">51 mins:</span> Another head injury. Williams down after being caught by Schoenfeld. Williams already has a mouth injury picked up in training after a clash with Danny Califf. They play rough in Philly.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">52 mins:</span> Gehrig caught out as Philadelphia press forward. He's relieved to see Adu's shot deflect into the arms of Gruenebaum. Gehrig's learning expensive lessons for the Crew adapting to this position.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">54 mins:</span> Adu runs at the heart of the defense then pops up on the right to send in a searching cross. Then Crew get forward as the game opens up. Suddenly the ball breaks to Vargas whose shot is saved point blank by Mac Math. Tempo up now.</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">56 mins:</span> That was a great reaction by MacMath - throwing himself at Vargas's feet as the striker shaped to shoot. After a shaky start to the season he's unbeaten in 200+ minutes now.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">57 mins:</span> Game definitely opening up now. Adu drops another neat cross into the box and Daniel drifts in behind Francis to head just over the bar. Great move.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">58 mins:</span> Still <strong>Philadelphia 1 Columbus 0</strong> as we come up to the hour. Now it's the Crew's turn to send in a teasing cross but MacMath claims it confidently. From the break Pajoy looks to have been fouled on the edge of the box, but Michael Kennedy gives nothing and the Crew breathe again.</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">60 mins:</span> Speed of the game faster in the second half and the ball is arriving in more threatening areas, but still few clear cut chances. Some neat build up play from Columbus breaks down on the edge of the box.</p><!-- Block 58 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">61 mins:</span> Surprising substitution: Martinez comes on for Adu, who stomps off and gives Nowak the briefest of handshakes. Nowak presumably is humming \"My Way\"...</p><!-- Block 59 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">63 mins:</span> Philadelphia attack and Pajoy's cutback is just cut out by Gehrig. Martinez looking lively early, but Adu was contributing strongly right up to the substitution, so that looks like a strange one.</p><!-- Block 60 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">65 mins:</span> Now Crew make a substitution. Finlay comes out for Anor - trying to spark the midfield a little. Immediately he has a chance from outside the box and flashes a shot just across MacMath.</p><!-- Block 61 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">67 mins:</span> Renteria warming up. 8 goals in 18 games last season. Crew could do with one now.</p><!-- Block 62 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">68 mins:</span> Crew trying to get the ball forward more quickly now - perhaps in recognition of that changed Philadelphia formation. Renteria on for Schoenfeld, who battled all game.</p><!-- Block 63 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">69 mins:</span> Renteria tries to wriggle through on the edge of the box, but is bundled off the ball. Now Nowak looks to his bench again. Looks like Okugo is coming on to shore the midfield up.</p><!-- Block 64 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">71 mins:</span> Gomez is pulled out for Okugo, who's a more defensive minded midfielder than Gomez. He'll sit deep in front of the defense.</p><!-- Block 65 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">72 mins:</span> Mirosevic fires a sharp cross in to the near post where Williams injures himself yet again heading clear. Vukovic comes on for Francis for the Crew's final substitution.</p><!-- Block 66 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">74 mins:</span> Urso's corner is headed clear for another one. A low driven one is cleared for yet another Crew corner...</p><!-- Block 67 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">75 mins:</span> It's hit long then curled back in beautifully towards the back post, but once again MacMath claims confidently, to the Union's relief. This may be a rearguard action in the last 15 minutes.</p><!-- Block 68 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">76 mins:</span> Understandable gap opening up between Union front two and the players behind them. Pragmatism winning here. Still <strong>Philadelphia 1 Columbus 0</strong>.</p><!-- Block 69 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">78 mins:</span> Eddie Gaven picks up a yellow for dragging down Farfan. Free kick in Crew half, taken backwards by a cautious Philadelphia.</p><!-- Block 70 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">79 mins:</span> Mirosevic tries to thread a ball through the heart of the Crew defense, but that midfield plug in front of the defense holds firm.</p><!-- Block 71 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">80 mins:</span> The second half has zipped by and now the Union are ten minutes from their first win of the season. Columbus still trying to ask questions and a Renteria headed flick almost causes a problem in the Union box.</p><!-- Block 72 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">82 mins:</span> Unusually positive move for the Union as Gaddis bombs forward down the right. He wins a throw and Union try to retain possession.</p><!-- Block 73 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">83 mins:</span> ALMOST THE CLINCHER! Pajoy breaks free as the ball comes over the top and Marshall just gets a toe in to deny him the goal that would have surely sealed it. Will they regret that?</p><!-- Block 74 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">85 mins:</span> Now Martinez picks up a yellow for an untidy foul in the center circle. Crew throw players forward and Anor wins a header in the box - but it runs clear of his fellow players and across for the goal kick.</p><!-- Block 75 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">87 mins:</span> Columbus trying to press, but lacking dangerous quality in the final third right now. Philadelphia pick up a free kick deep in their own half and look to slow things down again.</p><!-- Block 76 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">88 mins:</span> Slightly shapeless pressure from Columbus, but Philadelphia force it clear. Plenty of effort but little cutting edge from the Crew.</p><!-- Block 77 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">90 mins:</span> Long ball into the box which Macmath can't retrieve. Vargas was backing into him though and gives up the foul. Some pushing and shoving in the aftermath. Columbus frustrated now.</p><!-- Block 78 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">90 mins +1:</span> 4 minutes to be added on. Union are looking to make a sub to eat up some of that time. But Crew have a dangerous free kick in the middle of the Union half.</p><!-- Block 79 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">90 mins +2:</span> Urso's kick is headed clear. Hoppenot comes on for Pajoy. Long throw comes into the box...</p><!-- Block 80 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">90 mins +3:</span> ...hoofed clear, but then thrown back in and Marshall flicks the ball on for Anor to charge in and head just past the post. MacMath booked for time wasting in aftermath.</p><!-- Block 81 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">90mins +5:</span> Another half chance for Columbus - they've looked more threatening in added time than they've looked for most of the second half, but...</p><!-- Block 82 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">Peep! Peep! PEEP!:</span> And that's that. <strong>Philadelphia 1 Columbus 0</strong>. The Union have their first win! Final thoughts in a minute...</p><!-- Block 83 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">Final Thoughts:</span> It wasn't pretty, but Peter Nowak will not care in the slightest. Adu seems to have forgotten his displeasure at being substituted and has given a relieved pitch side interview. He'll be glad to have got a significant run out after the US Under-23 misadventures. The Union will be glad for the home win to hopefully get their season going.</p><p>If Columbus were looking for a response from last week's game against New York, they'll have been disappointed to still look the more lightweight of the two sides today. They had flashes of threat going forward but never really cohered and now head home for the tricky visit of Houston next Saturday.</p><p>Thanks for your tweets and e-mails.

        "body":"<p>It is one of the most improbable family connections. One is an actor famed as a languid Lothario. The other was one of the world's most brutal but brilliant military leaders. Nevertheless geneticists say their analysis shows Tom Conti is indeed directly related to Napoleon Bonaparte.</p><p>This remarkable claim has been made by <a href=\"http://www.scotlandsdna.com/\" title=\"\">ScotlandsDNA</a>, a recently launched project that aims to uncover the genetic roots of the Scots and which now plans to spread its services to include the English, Welsh and Irish. From a participant's saliva, project scientists obtain a DNA marker that can pinpoint their ancestry. Conti and Bonaparte both share a marker known as M34.</p><p>\"Some friends said they weren't surprised to find out Napoleon and I were related, but it came as quite a shock to me,\" Conti told the <em>Observer</em>. \"In fact, I didn't believe it at first. I burst out laughing when they told me. I have got used to it now and am really rather pleased.\"</p><p>ScotlandsDNA, soon to be renamed <a href=\"http://www.britainsdna.com/\" title=\"\">BritainsDNA</a>, was set up last year by historian Alistair Moffat, the current rector of St Andrews University, and Dr Jim Wilson, a geneticist based at Edinburgh University. Their aim was to create a genetic map of Scotland. Now Moffat and Wilson are expanding this project to cover the whole of the British Isles.</p><p>Two sources of information are used \u2013 markers on <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/apr/25/mitochondrial-dna-human-evolution\" title=\"\">mitochondrial DNA</a>, which is passed exclusively through the female line, from mother to daughter, and markers on the Y-chromosome, which is passed from father to son.</p><p>More than 1,000 people, each paying £170, have provided DNA that reveals the Scots' wide ancestry \u2013 Vikings, Irish, Berbers \u2013 and many other distinctive markers have been uncovered. This work has also thrown up many unexpected stories. The BBC presenter Jim Naughtie \u2013 despite his Aberdeenshire accent \u2013 was found to be of Northumbrian origin, while the comedian Fred MacAulay is probably descended from Irishmen enslaved by Vikings in the ninth century, according to Moffat. \"Our DNA can reveal so many unexpected things about our past and there is no better example than Tom Conti's,\" he said.</p><p>Thomas Antonio Conti was born in 1941 in Paisley to Alfonso, his Italian immigrant father, and Mary McGoldrick, his Irish Catholic mother. \"When I joined the DNA project, I expected my mother's side would be the most interesting,\" said Conti. \"She was of Irish stock and I thought her thick black hair, which I inherited, would reveal a Spanish connection, perhaps from Armada sailors shipwrecked in Ireland. But it was my father's side that proved to be most interesting.\"</p><p>According to Moffat, Conti's DNA marker reveals his male lineage is Saracen in origin. His ancestors settled in Italy around the 10th century before one of them, Giovanni Buonaparte, settled in Corsica and founded the family branch that produced Napoleon.</p><p>\"The crucial point is we know what DNA markers Napoleon had on his Y-chromosome,\" said Moffat. \"Last year, a reliquary containing some of his hairs was opened and DNA was extracted from their roots. The genetic marker from it proved to be identical to the one found in Prince Charles Napoleon Bonaparte, the French politician who is the great-great-grandnephew of Napoleon. All have an M34 marker, including Tom Conti. He is clearly a close relative of Napoleon. Only DNA could have told that story.\"</p><p>Ancestors of the Bonaparte clan are rare in Britain, added Moffat. However, other leaders have left quite profound lineages, such as an Irish king, Niall of the Nine Hostages, whose kin dominated northern Ireland from the sixth to the 10th centuries. The offspring of these kings, known as the followers of Neill, or the Ui Neill, evolved into clans that include the O'Neils, Bradleys \u2013 and the McKies. Tests, including one taken by this correspondent, reveal that around 6% of Scotsmen \u2013 whose ancestors emigrated from Ireland \u2013 are related to each other through the Ui Neill lineage.</p><p>On Tuesday, Moffat and his team will host a party at the Royal Society of Edinburgh for some of the first 500 participants in the ScotlandsDNA project.</p><p>\"We will have Vikings, Irish, Saxons, Angles and dozens of others \u2013 the Scots in short. This is the power of DNA analysis and we want to open it up for all of Britain,\" Moffat said.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/science&k=Genetics&k=Scotland&k=UK+news&k=Biology&k=Science\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/science/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/science/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=DNA+project+reveals+Tom+Conti%27s+Napoleonic+blood+and+rich+roots+of+Scotland%27s+genetic+legacy+Article+1731314&ch=Science&c2=148491&c4=Genetics+%28Science%29%2CScotland+%28News%29%2CUK+news%2CBiology%2CScience&c3=The+Observer&c6=Robin+McKie%2C+science+editor&c7=12-Apr-14&c8=1731314&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: science/2012/apr/14/tom-conti-napoleon-bonaparte-genes|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|06dacc2043ecff0f4e20c959f1f63e60bee740d9 -->",

        "body":"<p>\"What do you mean Miss?... Have we got to walk?\u2026 Where is the school minibus... walking is so gay!\".</p><p>The mutation of the term \"gay\" into playground slang for anything or anyone that students don't like or don't want to do has quite rightly always been challenged. When spoken to, students are often indignant or simply do not comprehend that this language is inappropriate. \"We aren't being homophobic... it's just a word we use...\" However, persistence, and a will to change the acceptability of the use of expressions such as \"gay\" that cause offence has had an impact, and certainly we have seen their use in the playground decrease over time.</p><p>In a similar way, attitudes to racism and racist language have altered significantly since the death of Stephen Lawrence and the publication of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/feb/24/lawrence.ukcrime12\" title=\"MacPherson report\">MacPherson report</a>.  Such language is now universally seen as unacceptable by teachers, students and parents alike. Such a change did not take place over night.  It took the efforts of parents, teachers, the school curriculum and time. It is clear now that attitudes to racist and homophobic language in schools have shifted significantly, but is there more to be done?</p><p>The language used to describe mental health issues, and the taboos surrounding their discussion in school are all too evident. Compare for example the reaction of our students to the tragic death of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/jan/30/gary-speed-taking-life-inquest\" title=\"Gary Speed\">Gary Speed</a> and the heart attack suffered by <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fabrice-muamba\" title=\"Fabrice Muamba\">Fabrice Muamba</a>. Both events struck a chord with our boys, yet we found it much easier to discuss and react to Fabrice's heart condition than Gary's mental health issues.</p><p>With Fabrice Muamba, the reaction of parents, students and teachers was: \"this might happen to one of us... we need to get more heart screening and a defibrillator\"</p><p>With Gary Speed, the reaction was very different.  Students did not understand, and when questioned some teachers did not feel empowered to discuss. Parents, teachers and students never entertained the idea that this is something that may happen to them or their family. Real sadness and empathy for Gary and his family, but discussion of mental health issues? I am afraid not.</p><p>Young people today come into contact with mental health issues in a variety of forms, whether it be depression, dependency or dementia. So is it right that the use of the terms \"mental\", \"nutter\" or \"mad\" are routinely heard used by both staff and students alike?</p><p>Some would argue that all such terms be banned from use and challenged when heard. I would suggest that a more open discussion around the issues surrounding mental health and the casual, sometimes hurtful, terms used to describe it just as we have with both racist and homophobic language.</p><p>The impact that such words can have on a young person in the midst of living or dealing with mental health problems cannot be underestimated, and may not be easy to spot, as often these circumstances are not known about by staff.</p><p>Unless we give young people the emotional tools to express and discuss their feelings, we are in danger of avoiding the part that mental health so often plays in in their lives. At <a href=\"http://www.carshaltonboys.org\" title=\"Carshalton Boys\">Carshalton Boys</a>, citizenship education has played a vital role, yet these lessons are under threat in secondary schools with the reshaping of the national curriculum and greater pressure to study subjects to full course GCSE level.</p><p>Another useful resource for us has come from <a href=\"http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/youngpeople\" title=\"Time to Change\">Time to Change</a>, an anti-stigma campaign run by the leading mental health charities, Mind and Rethink Mental Illness. Time to Change have run several television <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/timetochange\" title=\"TIme to Change\">advertising campaigns</a> aimed at people who know someone with a mental health problem \u2013 family, friends, colleagues and neighbours \u2013 but who don't realise the harmful impact their attitudes, behaviours and language can have.</p><p>These short videos have been invaluable in providing stimulus material for teachers to use with students when discussing mental health issues and have had a real impact on students' attitudes language and behaviour.</p><p>So is \"mental\" the new \"gay\"? I would suggest that both terms need to be challenged and acknowledged as issues to be discussed and not shied away from with young people if we are to ensure that the taboos of society around mental health are not passed on to the next generation.</p><p>\u2022 Simon Barber has been the headteacher at Carshalton Boys Sports College in South West London for 11 years.</p><h2>Simon Barber was one of the guests at a Guardian roundtable in association with <a href=\"http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/youngpeople\" title=\"Time to Change\">Time to Change</a>.

        "headline":"Shut Up And Play The Hits: the men behind the LCD Soundsystem movie",
        "body":"<p>Where were you when James Murphy brought the curtain down on LCD Soundsystem? Fast asleep, probably, given that the final notes of their four-hour farewell concert in Madison Square Garden last April came at just before 1am New York time. But for those who wish they had been there, and also those who can only scratch their heads when confronted with the assertion that LCD were the most important band of their generation, there is a film on its way that can help with that.</p><p>Shut Up And Play The Hits documents the last night in the life of the disco-punk pioneers and the morning after. It's both a concert movie \u2013 early screenings at Sundance and South By Southwest have turned into impromptu nightclubs \u2013 and a study in endings, of a band, of a body of work, perhaps even a generation.</p><p>The film's directors are Will Lovelace and Dylan Southern, two Brits responsible for No Distance Left To Run, the fascinating study of Blur during their 2010 reunion. With a background in music videos, the pair claim they were looking to move out of studying bands at close quarters, until they were introduced to Murphy in London by a mutual friend.</p><p>\"I think James is a little bit of an Anglophile,\" says Southern. \"He spends a lot of time over here, among other places, and we met him London and just had a chat. We knew that LCD were ending and that the album that had just come out [This Is Happening] was the final ever one. But we were all pretty keen at the start that it wasn't going to be the definitive story of the band. It was never going to be a biography film in the way that maybe the Blur one was.\"</p><p>\"We talked about making a document of the event, rather than anything else,\" says Lovelace. That event was the final, 19,500-capacity concert at New York's iconic venue, and the plan was to make a film using footage caught by 11 different cinematographers, Spike Jonze and Yorick Le Saux (Carlos, I Am Love) among them. \"We got cinematographers rather than camera operators and people who didn't necessarily shoot shows, so that they hadn't become bored of it,\" explains Southern. They also had three cameras in the roof. \"One of them we put in a stupid position, though,\" says Southern, \"so for three-and-a-half hours you just got a shot of some out-of-focus balloons.\"</p><p>The cinematographers were instructed to shoot what they found most interesting, be it on stage or off (during the song Us V Them, Jonze spent most of his time filming a couple making out in the crowd). \"That half-an-hour before the show with all the cinematographers was the most exciting bit for me,\" says Lovelace, \"because usually they don't work together and they really didn't know quite what they were going to get.\" What emerges is an impressionistic take that captures the thrill of the music, the enthusiasm of the fans and the lingering hint of melancholy as Murphy and crew create one last party.</p><p>But while the concert and the music is at its heart (Murphy mixed the sound for the movie himself), there is another strand to the film, one that looks at why a band who play in front of 19,500 people would give it up, and what they might do next. In the film, Murphy is quizzed on his motivations by the author Chuck Klosterman (recruited after Southern and Lovelace read his interview with Murphy for the Guardian). It becomes clear that they are less about the band and more about himself: his fear of burning out on the road, of being seen to milk his career for fame. \"One of the reasons was because he didn't want to become any more famous than he is,\" says Lovelace.</p><p>There is also a sense of Murphy being supremely self-conscious, always second-guessing himself and his motivations. That he might, therefore, become a figurehead for a generation of hipsters for whom irony was a default setting seems rather appropriate. For Southern, the MSG concert marked a moment for the hipster, too. \"It was a real consideration of ours, because originally we were going to extend the film out to the Williamsburg scene and see what was happening with that whole hipster generation. As it approached, the concert felt more and more significant for that. LCD seemed to play such an important part over the last 10 years and them ending and the way the world is changing seemed like a theme for the film.\" Says Lovelace, \"It definitely felt like a full stop.\"</p><p>As for Murphy, that full stop seems to leave him a little bereft. The day after the concert, he mooches around his Williamsburg flat, obsessively cleaning his coffee machine. He breaks down in a storage room full of retired musical equipment; he is left by his manager sitting alone outside a cafe. It's affecting, whether you've ever heard of Murphy before or not. \"It's a universal idea,\" says Southern. \"The themes apply to you as a viewer. It's a fine line between sentimentality and documenting the thing, but, for us, we were telling a story and we did want to affect people.\" </p><p><strong><em>Shut Up And Play The Hits premieres in the UK at  the Sundance London Festival on 27, 28 and 29 April.

        "headline":"Problem solved",
        "body":"<p><strong>My husband and I are in our late 60s and are worried about our 13-year-old grandson. Our son, 38, has suffered mental ill health since his early teens with quite long periods of stability when he married and had our grandson, and was employed. His marriage collapsed four years ago, triggering his third major breakdown. He has a small ill-health retirement pension, which, combined with disability benefits, means he can survive financially. He has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder and depression. He also has an inherited heart condition. </strong></p><p><strong>Despite this, our son is a good father. Our ex-daughter-in-law is glamorous and likes clubbing and socialising. Since their divorce, she and my son have had a difficult relationship. She obviously knows&nbsp;a great deal about our son's&nbsp;illness, but makes increasing demands on him for childcare \u2013 especially now he is not working. He does his best to accommodate all these demands and to be a good father. </strong></p><p><strong>However, our grandson has only ever really wanted to be with his mother. At our son's flat, he sleeps with his mother's photo under his pillow, which I find disturbing, and phones her several times a day. He is a&nbsp;young 13, timid and underconfident. His friends are all near his mother's home so when he is with my son, he has no schoolfriends nearby. </strong></p><p><strong>He has begun to voice aggressively (to our son) objections to the arrangements made for him by his parents, but&nbsp;he is loyal and sensitive and, probably, taking on more responsibility and concerns for his father's sometimes strange and unpredictable behaviour than is right for a child.</strong></p><p><strong>We have, over the years, given our son a huge amount of emotional, practical and financial support. My husband has severe disabilities following cancer and a heart condition, and I feel depressed and anxious about the future and how to help our son and grandson.</strong></p><p><strong>As a boy, our son was a delight, loving, affectionate and close to me. Now he longs to be independent and resents his need of me. We feel that as our physical and emotional energy is dwindling, our grandson is less likely to continue to accommodate his parents' arrangements and will become more demanding (quite rightly) of his own needs. <em>F, Somerset</em></strong></p><p></p><p>Good on your grandson if he starts being more demanding of his own needs. I talked to Neil Austin, consultant child and adolescent psychotherapist at Great Ormond Street hospital, about your situation. Neither he, nor I, think it odd that your grandson sleeps with his mother's photo under his pillow. \"It's common to idolise one parent when separated,\" says Austin. \"What the child desperately wants is for the parents to be back together, so your grandson is probably thinking [when he sleeps at his father's]: 'Dad's here, Mum's under the pillow, they're both here.'\"</p><p>Austin also said your grandson might be \"beset with anxiety about losing his mother, either emotionally or physically, or both\".</p><p>You may see your ex-daughter-in-law as the lesser parent (this was the impression I got from your letter), but to your grandson, she may well be the easier and less stressful option than a father with, as you put it \"sometimes strange and unpredictable behaviour\". Perhaps he feels he can be more what he is \u2013 a 13-year-old boy \u2013 at his mum's house than at his dad's. Being sociable and glamorous doesn't make her a bad parent and I wonder if you're really being fair to her.</p><p>It would be useful if your son and his ex could attend family therapy to work out how to be effective and responsible parents: they need to work together on this (<a href=\"http://aft.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Association for Family Therapy</a>; <a href=\"http://childpsychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">the Association of Child Psychotherapists</a>). Your grandson may also benefit from being able to speak to someone in a place where he can voice his own feelings without fear of how it will affect others.</p><p>I can sense how much you want to help, but am left wondering if you have been over-involved in your son's life and have never let him be independent.</p><p>Neil Austin also wanted to make sure your son was being properly treated for his illnesses \u2013 is he?</p><p></p><h2>Your problems solved<br /></h2><p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email <a href=\"mailto:annalisa.barbieri@mac.com\" title=\"\">annalisa.barbieri@mac.com</a>.

        "headline":"Dear Jeremy \u2013 your work issues solved",
        "body":"<h2><strong>I need help getting to grips with bureaucracy of a large organisation </strong><br /></h2><p><strong>After four years of self-employment I&nbsp;recently started a job that I love, in an organisation I admire. However, my enthusiasm has been somewhat dampened by the processes and bureaucracy of the organisation. </strong></p><p><strong>When I want to do something my instinct is to go directly to the person who will help me achieve this, completely forgetting about informing their line manager or other departments that might have a say in this.</strong></p><p><strong>I also don't understand email etiquette: for instance, why so many emails and why people need to be copied in on emails or who to copy on an email \u2013 if at all.</strong></p><p><strong>I go from berating myself for not understanding that large organisations are a big web of people who need to be informed at all times in order to work to a common strategy, to becoming frustrated as I spend little time doing my \"real\" job and a lot of time trying to understand the system.</strong></p><p><strong>I don't want to go back to self-employment. I'm also on an interim job contract (maternity cover) so I want to leave this job having made a good impression. However, I think I'm going to spend more time trying to understand how it works than actually contributing to the organisation. Is this a common frustration when dealing with a large organisation?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p><p>Let me piece together three facts. You've just spent four years being self-employed. You've only recently joined this big organisation. And big organisations have communications needs that self-employed people don't.</p><p>Please don't jump to the conclusion that, by listing these facts, I'm about to blame all your dissatisfaction exclusively on you. I'm not.</p><p>Take the email issue. I often think that if people were rationed in the number of ccs they could append to each email, or if they were charged a nominal sum for every cc they added above, say, three, then some sort of corporate sanity might be restored.</p><p>The trouble, of course, is that emails appear to carry no cost; that an email with 35 ccs seems to be no more extravagant than an email with two; and that, while people might well be criticised for omitting someone's name from an email, they'll seldom be criticised for including half the company. So better safe than sorry: in goes everybody.</p><p>As a newcomer, fresh from self-employment, you'll be far more acutely aware of all this than the old-timers. You've yet to acquire familiarity. It's a bit like that little wine stain on the sitting-room carpet; after a time, you stop noticing it.</p><p>The other thing you've yet to acquire is low cunning. Almost instinctively, intelligent people in large organisations learn to conform to those procedures that are necessary and helpful for them and work their way round those that aren't. It's almost impossible for any large company to devise rules and systems that are equally applicable to absolutely everybody.</p><p>The longer you stay with this company, the simpler life will seem. But in the meantime, don't waste the value of your newcomer's eye. There will be some procedures, probably rooted in the past, that have no current value whatsoever. In the gentlest possible manner, you should bring these to the attention of your manager.</p><p></p><p><strong>Readers say</strong></p><p>\u2022 How on earth did someone who has been self-employed fall right into the \"incredible, employees have to deal with bureaucracy\" trap? The ability to avoid that is one of the big motivators for a lot of us to be self-employed.</p><p>Some of us are made to be suppliers, not bureaucrats (which is a term that by no means applies just to public servants, a lot of other organisations are even worse). Maybe you are one of them? <strong>oommph</strong></p><p></p><p>\u2022 This is just how large companies work in my experience. The thing to remember is that you might think you know the way to get something done, but it's possible that another team is already half way through getting something done which is related. If you bypass the lines of communication then you might duplicate a lot of work.</p><p>That's the theory anyway; often people like to be involved for empire-building, which is just painful and frustrating. <strong>jayaess</strong></p><p></p><p>\u2022 The first thing I do when I start a new job is arm myself with an organisational chart, list of key contacts, any committees, who the directors are, etc, then I ask my new colleagues (once \u2013 I write it all down!) how things work \u2013 from getting post delivered to IT support. Think of this as your weapon rather than a hindrance to your job. The better you know how your organisation works, the faster you can operate in the long term.</p><p>It's worth spending the time doing this. Don't mention you find it a problem to your colleagues as it may look unprofessional and naive. Get to grips and take your job by the horns! Good luck. <strong>Ecomouse1</strong></p><h2><strong>My lazy boss is vocal, bossy and whispering. What can I do about it? </strong><br /></h2><p><strong>I am very happy at my workplace. Everything is great apart from my boss. He is not working hard enough and this is demotivating and unfair. He chats all day to other colleagues and would do anything to avoid work. He had a flexitime option agreed by his manager (to start and finish work 30 minutes earlier) but he's just coming in at the normal time and leaving 30 minutes early because nobody can check \u2013 I happen to know because I start early sometimes.</strong></p><p><strong>He's very vocal and bossy and his boss is not bothered. I have already complained about this but I can't achieve anything. I would love to work fewer hours and spend more time with my family and also beat the traffic.</strong></p><p><strong>Another issue which is annoying is that he whispers to other managers in the open plan office and it sounds like gossiping. It feels as if they are talking about us, the humble employees. I&nbsp;know there is not a lot I can do because I am not my boss's boss and I&nbsp;don't want to leave my job because of this. Is there anything I can do?</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p><p>You say you've already complained about your boss's time-keeping. I wonder who you complained to? Your boss's boss, perhaps? I can't imagine that went down too well.</p><p>However factually accurate your accusation, there's something fairly unappealing about an employee keeping an eye on a superior's punctuality and then reporting it. Complaining about inappropriate social behaviour \u2013 language, say, or harassment \u2013 is certainly OK and indeed responsible; but the fact that your boss routinely chops 30 minutes off his working day should be of concern only to management. You disapprove of his habits while at the same time wishing you could do the same. What's mainly bugging you is your sense of injustice. And you're letting it get to you.</p><p>It's often easy to tell when people have let things bug them: it's the \"and another thing\" condition. Your boss's whispering seems to me a perfect example. Because he irritates you in other ways, you've allowed yourself to believe (\"and another thing\") that he's gossiping about you and the rest of his \"humble employees\". He may be; but he probably isn't.</p><p>I know I sound unsympathetic, but I'm seriously concerned that you might quite needlessly allow your irritation to become an obsession \u2013 and that will do your  reputation no good at all.</p><p>By the sound of it, your boss is quite a flaky person. If he's as much of a chancer as you think he is, sooner or later someone will not only notice but also take action. Meanwhile, you have the rare good fortune to be very happy in your job. Everything other than your boss is great. Why put all that at risk by being seen to be a bit of a troublemaker with an almost unhealthy fixation? Do all you can to simmer down \u2013 and carry on regardless.</p><p></p><p><strong>Readers say</strong></p><p>\u2022 You say you are very happy at your workplace, yet your whole letter complains about a range of things that bother you. As an employee relations specialist, one of my bugbears is people who moan non-stop about a manager or a colleague yet won't actually have an informal conversation with the individual concerned about issues that bother or upset them.</p><p>It saves so much time and energy and makes for a happier, more open workplace. Your manager would probably be mortified and upset that you have such a low opinion of him.  <strong>DivineMrsMac</strong></p><p></p><p>\u2022 Instead of wasting time complaining about his behaviour you should work hard to prove how valuable your contribution to the company is, then request flexitime for yourself.

        "headline":"Mitt Romney plays to NRA interests in bid to win over conservative base",
        "body":"<p>Mitt Romney sought to win over the arch-conservative membership of the National Rifle Association by promising to be the protector of American freedoms and accusing President Obama of launching a stealth attack on the constitutional right to bear arms.</p><p>Addressing the NRA's annual convention in St Louis, Missouri, Romney tried to assuage doubts about his commitment to America's love affair with the gun by peppering his speech with references to the US constitution and liberal use of the word \"freedom\". </p><p>He also adopted the NRA's own language by warning that were Obama granted a second term in the White House he would unleash an assault on gun ownership rights in the US. That is precisely the NRA's lobbying argument, despite the fact that Obama has steered almost entirely clear of the gun issue in the past three years to the disappointment of gun control advocates.</p><p>\"In his second term, [Obama] would be unrestrained by the terms of re-election,\" Romney said. \"Who will stand up for the rights of hunters and sportsmen, and those who act to protect their families? President Obama has not. I will.\"</p><p>Romney paid lip service to the fact that Obama has proved to be non-interventionist on the gun issue, but that did not prevent him from accusing the White House of planning a secret conspiracy. \"The right to bear arms is so plainly stated, so unambiguous, that liberals have a hard time challenging it directly. Instead, they've been employing every imaginable ruse and ploy to restrict it,\" he said.</p><p>The NRA's annual meeting kicked off Friday with a display of high-powered assault weapons more customarily seen in Afghanistan or Iraq than in downtown St Louis. The event, expected to be attended by 70,000 NRA members, attracted a slew of top Republicans keen to solidify ties with this core conservative following.</p><p>In the run-up to the event the NRA has been filling its warchests for an election campaign in which it expects to spend up to $30m opposing the president's re-election. It has launched a nationwide campaign to sway the presidential election called Trigger the Vote.</p><p>It has also been ramping up its rhetoric against Obama, who it depicts as anti-freedom and anti-gun rights. Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice-president, has been leading the verbal assault with ever more shrill language.</p><p>In an article in the NRA's magazine, America's 1st Freedom, he writes that \"this year's election could prove the most disastrous in the history of this country\". He warns that Obama is dedicated to dismantling the second amendment \u2013 the right to keep and bear arms.</p><p>Contrary to LaPierre's dire forebodings, Obama has barely spoken on the subject of guns since he entered the White House, and gun controls have been rolled back during his term by seminal US supreme court rulings.</p><p>LaPierre gets around that inconvenient fact by warning voters that the president is poised to attack gun rights should he win a second term \u2013 an echo of what the NRA said ahead of his first election victory in 2008.</p><p>\"Obama has spent his entire political career engaged in a stealthy assault on your right to keep and bear arms. [If he wins] re-election to the White House, [he] will be immune from elections and free to misuse his ever-increasing power,\" LaPierre said.</p><p>Other key figures in the NRA have gone even further in their assaults on Obama. Ted Nugent, the ageing rocker who sits on the NRA board, called the president an \"anti-American monster in the White House\" in comments promoted on the NRA website.</p><p>The increasingly hysterical tone of the organisation's pronouncements is only to be expected in an election year, observers of the NRA say. \"For the guys running the NRA, every election has to be Armageddon. This year, it's 'Obama is one election away from repealing the second amendment and stealing your guns' \u2013 even though he's done nothing but expand gun rights,\" said Mark Glaze, director of the bipartisan coalition of more than 650 US mayors, Mayors Against Illegal Guns.</p><p>The coalition, led by New York's mayor Michael Bloomberg, this week launched a campaign against the NRA's promotion of stand-your-ground laws in the wake of the Trayvon Martin killing.</p><p>Glaze sees the NRA's tactics as part of its economic plan: \"You can't raise $240m a year without a business model based on paranoia and conflict.\"</p><p>Josh Sugarman, director of the Violence Policy Center, said that the NRA was twisting the reality. \"They are taking Obama's lack of action on the gun issue as proof that his second term will be the complete opposite. By saying that they are hoping to drive their people to vote, and to gen up gun sales.\"</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of Obama's election victory in November 2008 there was a spike in gun sales following NRA doom-mongering. A similar phenomenon is being witnessed again in the build-up to the November presidential election.</p><p>One online ammunition dealer, ammo.net, recently called Obama the \"greatest gun salesman in America\".</p><p>The gun manufacturer Sturm Ruger announced last month that its sales were at record levels amid the fears of an Obama second term and that it had put new orders on hold while it cleared the backlog.</p><p>The election-year spike belies the general trend in gun sales, which is one of gentle decline. Analysts of the gun industry say that fewer Americans are owning weapons today, but those who do own do so in increasing numbers, while the proportion of high-powered and assault rifles is also growing.</p><p>That shift towards military-grade weaponry was on display at the NRA convention in St Louis, where manufacturers were proferring guns normally seen on the battlefield. Nemo were among the retailers offering their wares, which include military-grade assault rifles such as the Omen.</p><p>The Montana-based company has a mission statement in which it commits itself to developing weapons that will enable special operations forces \"to carry out their missions knowing they are armed with the finest primary weopons available in the world\".</p><p>Also on display are Glock 9mm hand pistols as used by Jared Lee Loughner in the Tucson mass shooting of US congress member Gabrielle Giffords.</p><p>While the NRA is focusing this year on the race for the White House, increasingly its efforts are concentrated at state level where it has found it has the most success in pushing new laws favouring gun makers and owners. It has been an aggressive advocate of the right to carry concealed guns, which has spread across the America, and has fiercely resisted any attempt to regulate assault rifles.</p><p>The shooting of Trayvon Martin, and the huge uproar around stand-your-ground laws, particularly among African Americans, that ensued, will be the wild card of the gun debate in this election cycle. \"How will the NRA defend these laws that it promoted so heavily?\" asked Sugarman. He added that the NRA had remained notably silent on the subject.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=US+politics&k=United+States&k=Mitt+Romney&k=Barack+Obama&k=World+news&k=US+gun+control\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mitt+Romney+plays+to+NRA+interests+in+bid+to+win+over+conservative+base+Article+1731311&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=US+politics%2CUS+news%2CMitt+Romney+%28News%29%2CBarack+Obama+%28News%29%2CWorld+news%2CGun+control+%28US%29%2CMissouri+%28News%29%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CRepublicans+%28US%29%2CDemocrats%2CNRA+%28National+Rifle+Association%29&c3=Guardian+Weekly&c6=Ed+Pilkington+in+New+York+and+Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-13&c8=1731311&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/13/mitt-romney-nra-conservative-speech|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|1a2c5f82b51830c4bb08af3d8496c92e477c0ba5 -->",

        "body":"<p>One of the most fascinating and affecting pieces of journalism I have ever read appeared in an edition of Rolling Stone magazine in early 2007. An <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:EGBUZt3HH8cJ:regionalworkbench.org/USP2/pdf_files/pigs.pdf+rolling+stone+boss+hog&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShfzRSd45hsYzFSQIq4Zd5EP1kxU7jt0y_-m9zI9-Im-xBMl9WPeV5GbD2OqWnckbM1efnQBIAVGsMRpmAnnAULNg3qt0rCKasXh0uVGOJJVlFURJnLBqEg5jmKmBqsLbbtRglM&amp;sig=AHIEtbQHBSrlUGAHbslFrNAnugxPePDxug&amp;pli=1\" title=\"\">investigation into pig farming</a>, and more specifically the environmental impact of America's top pork producer, Smithfield Foods, it spoke of how \"500,000 pigs at a single Smithfield subsidiary in Utah generate more faecal matter each year than the 1.5 million inhabitants of Manhattan\" and estimated that this one company alone produced more than 26m tonnes of waste annually. \"A lot of pig shit is one thing,\" the article's author, Jeff Tietz, remarked. \"A lot of highly toxic pig shit is another.\"</p><p>It was Smithfield Foods I thought of this week, when I read of <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/2/024005/article\" title=\"\">a report published in Environmental Research Letters</a>, which advised that we reduce meat consumption by 50% over the next 40 years if we are to save ourselves from environmental catastrophe.</p><p>The author of the report, Eric Davidson of the <a href=\"http://www.whrc.org/\" title=\"\">Woods Hole Research Centre</a> in Massachusetts, advised that with great urgency we must cut back on both portion size and the quantity of meat we eat in an effort to reduce the amount of fertiliser we currently use \u2013 particularly in the west, but also in developing nations, where increasing prosperity has also brought a rise in meat consumption.</p><p>Fertilisers of course release nitrous oxide, one of the gases that cause climate change, and crops grown to feed animals produce more greenhouse gases than those used to feed humans. And this is before we have even addressed the gases released by animal manure \u2013 a highly toxic combination of fertilised feed, and all the antibiotics, vaccines and insecticides used to keep factory farmed animals \"healthy\".</p><p>Consider, too, the recent studies that have linked our use of pesticides <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/damian-carrington-blog/2012/apr/11/bees-pesticides-decline-colony-collapse\" title=\"\">with the devastation to the bee population</a>, and just how bleak a future without bees looks: a world in which we must hand-pollinate our crops, and where \u2013 as already happens in the US \u2013 bees are driven around, farm to farm, to pick up the work of their obliterated wild cousins.</p><p>And lastly, think of <a href=\"http://www.palgrave-journals.com/jphp/journal/v28/n2/abs/3200127a.html\" title=\"\">the size of the average burger</a>. In 1955, when McDonald's first introduced its hamburger, that burger weighed 1.6 ounces. Today, its largest hamburger weighs eight ounces. And in the highly competitive fast food industry, comparatively speaking, the Big Mac isn't even really that big any more.</p><p>All of this has repercussions \u2013 not only for our waistbands, or even the fact that producing clothes to fit those expanding waistbands requires the production of more fabric; and not even just for our own health, the strain on our hearts and lungs, the drain on our health services, the vast sums we spew on diet products and gym membership, the cost of building bigger aeroplane seats, cars and coffins to accommodate our growing bodies. No, our slavering greed, our lust for enormous portions, affects how much meat our farming industry is expected to produce \u2013 and not only produce, but produce quickly and cheaply; demands that increase the need for fertilisers, insecticides, antibiotics.</p><p>That we could protect our own futures and those of subsequent generations by maybe holding off on the ham sandwiches seems not the greatest of sacrifices. But the problem is that nobody \u2013 least of all privileged and still-prosperous westerners, likes to be told what they should or should not eat. We are spoiled rotten; an indignant gang of Veruca Salts and Augustus Gloops, determined that we should have as much belly pork or beef bourguignon as we want or crave, whenever we want or crave it.</p><p>But if we have learned anything from the current economic crisis, it should surely be that we cannot expect to have jam today and jam tomorrow. In environmental terms, we have bought on credit, we have maxed out our cards and gone way, way over our overdrafts.</p><p>And maybe what will save us is a great scientific bailout: a grand solution of artificially created meat, or a new generation of fertilisers, or robot bees, or whatever. Or maybe, just maybe, it's time for us to exercise a little self-restraint.</p><p></p><p>\u2022 Follow Comment is free on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/commentisfree\" title=\"\">@commentisfree</a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Food+%26+drink&k=The+meat+industry&k=Farming&k=World+news&k=Environment&k=Vegetarianism\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=We%27re+eating+too+much+meat+%E2%80%93+any+chance+of+a+portion+of+self-restraint%3F+%7C+Laura+Barton+Article+1731223&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=148491&c4=Food+and+drink++%28Life+and+style%29%2CMeat+industry+%28environment%29%2CFarming+%28environment%29%2CWorld+news%2CEnvironment%2CVegetarianism+%28Life+and+style%29%2CWildlife+%28Environment%29%2CPesticides+%28environment%29%2CConservation+%28Environment%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Laura+Barton&c7=12-Apr-13&c8=1731223&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/2012/apr/13/eating-too-much-meat|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|141226cd802b1a809593518f8822aba1bfebc3bd -->",

        "body":"<p>At the British Museum, Nazia Shah, 27, had embarked on a day out from Luton with half a dozen of her nephews. They fancied a theme park, but she took them to see <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/jan/25/hajj-journey-islam-review-british-museum\" title=\"\">Hajj: Journey to the Heart of Islam</a> before it closes .</p><p>But they looked far from despondent. \"It's good for the kids to get in contact with a bit of history and for them to know what's going on in the world,\" she said. A veteran of the pilgrimage to Mecca, the only thing she felt the exhibition lacked was a model of the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x06DjlWFwM4\" title=\"\">Jamarat</a>, the pillars stoned by the faithful. Next stop was the Natural History Museum \u2013 \"to tire them out properly.\"</p><p>Shah is one of an estimated 60,000 British Muslims who have visited the Hajj exhibition since it opened in January. The first museum show anywhere in the world to focus on the pilgrimage, in less than seven weeks it exceeded the museum's target of 80,000 visitors.</p><p>By the end of last Sunday, 119,948 adult tickets (under-16s get in free) had been sold at £12 each, with all advance tickets sold out and the museum opening for longer hours to accommodate the extra demand.</p><p>Though the museum does not monitor the religion of its visitors, director <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/neilmacgregor\" title=\"\">Neil MacGregor</a> estimated that more than half were Muslim, an unprecedented number. \"We've had groups coming in coaches from Birmingham, Manchester \u2013 all over the UK,\" said <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/25/hajj-exhibition-british-museum\" title=\"\">Qaisra Khan</a>, the exhibition's project curator. \"We're getting carloads of people. Just this morning a young girl tweeted me saying that nine family members came down from Bradford.\"</p><p>It's an impression borne out in the exhibition. \"Our teachers were telling us about the show so we thought we'd get here as quickly as possible,\" said Hymayrah Hoqe, 11, one of a dozen girls from a group organised by the <a href=\"http://www.eastlondonmosque.org.uk/\" title=\"\">East London mosque</a>.</p><p>Khan said the museum was surprised at how popular the show had been, although they had deliberately targeted Muslims over the two years it took to plan and market it.</p><p>First, Khan contacted Maqsood Ahmed, then senior adviser to Muslim communities in the Communities and Local Government department.</p><p>\"He pulled together the umbrella organisations and groups around the UK who had a good reputation and were moderate, and who would understand what we were doing with the exhibition, take it to their congregation or members and post information on their sites.\"</p><p>The groups included the <a href=\"http://www.the-cbh.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Council of British Hajjis</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.abhuk.com/\" title=\"\">Association of British Hujjaj</a>, both of whom help organise the Hajj for British Muslims.</p><p>The museum also invited local Muslim community groups into previews of the show to create a word-of-mouth buzz. \"Once one group is able to say 'we really recommend this' it spreads like wildfire,\" said Khan.</p><p>At the museum, the reaction from Muslims was strongly positive, though Malik, who had been on the Hajj, said it taught her little she did not already know.</p><p>The exhibition has been contentious, however, with <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/mar/18/nick-cohen-british-museum-hajj-saudi\" title=\"\">commentators including the Observer's Nick Cohen</a> claiming that it has been compromised by the involvement of the Saudi Arabian regime.</p><p>The state lent exhibits, including the seetanah, which covers the door of the Kaaba, while the exhibition is partnered with the King Abdulaziz Public Library and sponsored by the Islamic bank, HSBC Amanah.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/mehdihasan\" title=\"\">Mehdi Hasan</a>, who reviewed the show for the New Statesman <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01b1lnh/Front_Row_Hajj_at_the_British_Museum/\" title=\"\">and Radio 4</a>, said he acclaimed the exhibition for being \"something positive about Muslims in a country where all you get is terrorism and Halal meat scares\", but believed many Muslims would have had mixed feelings. You want to like it but you don't want to feel part of a Saudi spin operation. Hajj takes place in Saudi Arabia, it's run by the Saudi government, and they use it to promulgate their narrow, very sectarian view of Islam.\"</p><p>Under the Wahabi monarchy, much of medieval Mecca was bulldozed with the justification that religious relics encouraged idolatry.</p><p>\"They got away with zero criticism in the exhibition,\" said Hasan. \"When you get to the section on King Abdulaziz, the founder of the Saudi state, you get a [text] about what a moderniser he was, like he was the Tony Blair of Saudi Arabia. This is a man who as soon as he arrived in Mecca was smashing stuff up, killing people and flattening tombs, and yet is presented as this guy who made the trains run on time.</p><p>\"The British Museum is meant to be the great protector of global culture yet they've got nothing to say about the Saudi government tearing stuff down in Mecca and putting up hotel blocks and timeshares.\"</p><p>Hasan said the Saudis would be very pleased by the exhibition. \"They've got a huge boost for the Hajj which they need in terms of cash revenue. In that sense, they've made a very direct connection with British Muslims.\"</p><p>The museum responded that the Saudis had \"not contributed funds to this project or had any curatorial control over the content of the exhibition\".</p><p>\"I think most of our audiences recognised what we were trying to do, which was to display and demonstrate this very personal, spiritual journey,\" said Khan. \"It wasn't about the politics of it.\"</p><p>Having tapped into a new audience of British Muslims, Khan said that while no further exhibitions along the lines of Hajj were planned, she was confident they would return to the British Museum, whose <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/middle_east/room_34_the_islamic_world.aspx\" title=\"\">Islamic gallery</a> is run by the show's curator, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/2012/jan/18/arab-artists-spring-global-exhibitions\" title=\"\">Venetia Porter</a>.</p><p>Habib said she would return, and not just confine herself to the Islamic exhibits.</p><p>\"As the kids are getting older they're doing Vikings and Egyptians at school so it's good to get back here.\"</p><p>\"I've always been into museums,\" said Idil Yusuf, from south-east London, with daughter Jamila, three. \"Now she's of a certain age I'll be able to bring her down with me.\"</p><p>The group from the East London mosque, meanwhile, already seemed au fait with the place. \"We've all been here before,\" said Hoqe, \"and we'll come back with our family.\"</p><p><strong>\u2022 Correction 17/4:</strong> The piece wrongly stated that the Mahmal tent had been lent by the Saudi Arabian state. In fact it was lent by the Nasser D. Khalili Collection of Islamic Art.

        "trailText":"<p>In fact, the Windows 8 Consumer Preview works well, even on hardware designed for Windows 7. But the acid test may rest with the hardware companies. By <strong>Matthew Baxter-Reynolds</strong></p>",
        "headline":"I survived a week on Windows8 on a tablet (instead of an iPad)",
        "body":"<p>Windows 8 is Janus's own operating system - a \"legacy\" mode for running any Windows app products in the past 20 years, and a \"post-PC\", iPad-like mode called Metro-style. At the beginning of March I wrote a piece about how this <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/mar/05/windows-8-desktop-experience\">arrangement did not work well on the desktop</a>. </p><p>Towards the end of this year it's expected that proper iPad-competing Windows 8 tablets will hit the market. I wanted to know how these devices might fare in the market, so I gave my iPad to my kids for the week and headed out into world, Windows tablet in hand. How did I get on?</p><h2>tl;dr</h2><p>The \"tl;dr\" version? It's fine. It's better than fine actually - it's really good. Metro-style on a tablet makes sense in exactly the same way as Metro-style on a desktop does not.</p><h2>OK, so a bit more detail?</h2><p>I took a Windows 7 tablet - specifically a Acer Iconia Tab W500 - and installed the Windows 8 Consumer Preview on it. The W500 has a dual-core 1GHz AMD C-Series processor, 2GB of RAM, a 32GB SSD and a 10.1\" 1280x800 screen. </p><p>Over the course of the week, I asked ten individuals - a mix of clients, friends, and acquaintances to try out some simple tasks on the device as well as using it instead of my iPad. </p><p>What I wasn't interested in was the hardware. Normal Windows tablets are rubbish compared to what's expected of proper, Windows on ARM (WOA) tablets that are expected to arrive by the end of the year. The Acer unit in particular is no iPad - it's a plasticky lump of a thing, as opposed to the sleek glass-and-metal iPad. But, I was only after a \"good enough\" analogue of an iPad, and the Acer fitted the bill.</p><p>I also wasn't that fussed about the quality of the supplied apps. Windows 8 is still a beta and, to be honest, the built-in People and Mail apps (the largest and most novel of the apps built into Windows 8) are very ropey.</p><p>So what works well? The keyboard is the first standout good element to consider. Typing on a touchscreen is never the most gloriously satisfying experience, but the Windows 8 implementation is solid. It's excellent at seamlessly correctly typing mistakes in the same way the iPad keyboard does. </p><p>One thing you can't do with an iPad is use \"handwriting mode\". This works really well with Windows 8 - able to ably transform the most illegible rubbish into actual words. </p><p>Here's where a conductive spider crawled across the screen, mimicking how a handwritingly-challenged individual might write \"handwriting\". (This image has been edited, mainly because I was too slow to capture the whole area over LogMeIn but it is the same scrawl that was transformed as per the next image.)</p><p><br />Can your iPad do this? Could your Newton? </p><p>Web browsing also works well. In one session, my son and I were sitting on the sofa browsing Amazon for <a href=\"http://www.gruffalo.com/\">Gruffalo paraphernalia</a>  and we were both happily sharing the screen in exactly the same way as we might with the iPad. Scrolling performance wasn't quite on par with the iPad, but that could well have been the hardware.</p><p>Generally, then, good marks so far.</p><h2>How did the others find it?</h2><p>It was quite fun to see how people got on with this device. For those of a technical persuasion, the first thing I asked them to do was to get it to join wireless network. They all failed.</p><p>All of them instinctively knew how to drive the Start screen and found swiping left and right obvious. They could start apps, and they could find their way to the Start screen by using the sole hardware button on the front of the device.</p><p>What they all failed to work out was how to access the Charms and menus that you can command into view by swiping from the bezel onto the screen. (Swiping from the right-hand side brings up the Charms bar. From there, you can access Settings, and from there Wireless.) Some of them worked out that you could swipe in from the left, or the top, but failed to experiment from swiping from the bottom or right, even though they'd seen these other two gestures work.</p><p><br />Charms. Charming charms. Charms that charm. Hated the name at first. Quite like it now.</p><p>I'm intensely relaxed about this, though. If you were from another planet and I told you that in order to access a list of running apps on our current market-leading post-PC tablet [IPAD DOESN'T OUTSELL IPHONE] you put four fingers on the screen and pushed up, you'd look at me with whatever passed for \"quizzically\" on your home planet, and I'd feel faintly embarrassed for myself and humankind. How about on the iPhone, where double-pressing the Home button on the lock screen lets you access the music player controls? Some of these actions aren't obviously discoverable, nor self-evident; what's important is whether they make sense once you've learnt them. Once I explained the gestures to the people trying out the device, they generally got on OK.</p><p>One niggle about the off-screen gestures relates to speed: you have swipe in from the side sloooowly - a fast swipe won't register. My best guess on why relates to how Microsoft has implemented off-screen gestures. Rather than insisting OEMs install touch-sensitivity on the bezel, the single pixel around the edge of screen is preserved by the OS to detect \"offscreen-to-onscreen\" gestures. Thus on my screen, if no touch has been detected and you get a touch on pixel 1199 on a 1200 pixel wide display, the systems deduces you've come in from the right, and the OS will show the Charms bar. </p><p>(Oddly, the lock screen isn't like this - power up the display and you can zip up and access the password/PIN field in milliseconds. In fact, that's a key feature of the otherwise laughable <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.co.uk/blogs/jacks-blog-10017212/microsoft-smoked-by-windows-phone-loss-10025744/\">Smoked by Windows Phone</a> campaign.)</p><p>The one gesture that no one discovered was the slightly batty \"task switcher\" gesture. This displays a list of the running apps, and requires you to pull in from the left hand side (which typically lets you \"Alt+Tab\" between apps), wait until it registers and then reverse and go back. I knew such a view existed, but I didn't suss out how to access it - I had to ask Microsoft-watcher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/tomwarren\">Tom Warren</a> how to do it.</p><p><br />The task switcher. This year's award for most obscure gesture goes to the Windows 8 Metro Shell team.</p><p>In summary, the feedback I got was good. People seemed to like it. Some basic training was required, but I didn't feel the mental workout required in learning the gestures was any more or less onerous than Apple demands of iPad users.</p><h2>Apps</h2><p>Having left my kids with the iPad knowing that it was going to spend the week letting them play Princess Fairy Sticker Album HD 2000 Special Unicorn Edition and endless repetitions of The Gruffalo, I was left wondering what I actually use my iPad for.</p><p>I do some gaming, I watch quite a lot of iTunes content, I use Twitter a lot, I use Evernote, web browsing, and I suspect that's what most people use it for. Most of the installed apps on my iPad are games for the kids where the iPad market is just unbelievably strong in terms of games for the under 5s. </p><p>To misquote Bill Clinton, is it a case of \"it's the apps, stupid\"? Not to ruin the end of this story, but when the week was up I'd forgotten I was supposed to be using the Windows tablet and had gone back to using the iPad without thinking about it. I'd actually left the Windows tablet in the car boot (graveyard of many an Android tablet or PlayBook I suspect); as soon as I clocked the iPad I forgot all about the Windows tablet. That's because one of the things I'd really missed on the Windows tablet was a good Twitter client. A combination of the Twitter web client and the work-in-progress implementation of IE10, together with a slightly underpowered device, results in an implementation which is cute and clever but features a please-god-stab-with-me-a-knife-to-end-the-pain style of user experience. Blergh. I needed a proper Twitter client. I tried using <a href=\"http://www.metrotwit.com/\">MetroTwit</a> on the legacy desktop (which some people rave about), but I found the reverse of my Windows 7.1 desktop experience, in that I couldn't handle switching between Metro and the legacy desktop. </p><p>What WOA is going to need is apps. Lots of apps. But with Android tablets having gone nowhere despite a fair wind, are Metro-style apps facing the same fate?</p><p>In this interesting article piece about <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2401676,00.asp\">\"Why Android tablet apps suck\"</a>, the author says:</p><blockquote><p>There's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem here for developers and users. Apple solved it, in a way, by making the iPhone app experience on iPads so bad that developers had no choice but to code for the iPad. The iPad runs iPhone apps, but not in a way in which anyone would be proud.</p></blockquote><p>I think that's key. </p><p>Apple's lousy toolset for iOS forces developers into creating each app through a process that is really, incredibly involved. With Android, you can waltz into the office at 9am, start working on \"tabletifying\" your app at about 10, take a long leisurely lunch, spent half the afternoon gassing about football and still have the job finished and signed off by 5pm. You're not going to get away with that with iPad. You're going to need to <em>craft</em> that sucker using things called \"hard work\" and \"time\".</p><p>If you run a normal iPhone app on an iPad, all the OS does is scale the iPhone display, showing the content at either 1x or 2x zoom. That unmistakably doesn't make the most of the device, and looks rubbish. For example, if you bring up the keyboard you get a big iPhone keyboard, not the proper iPad keyboard. On Android, the graphical layout subsystem works on a dynamic layout system that doesn't really care about the device's screen resolution. As a result, it can properly scale portrait-style layout on a phone to a landscape-style layout on a tablet and everything looks \u2026 well, <em>OK</em>. It's better than the iPhone=on-iPad kludge, but it's rarely beautiful. </p><p>The problem though is that it is good enough to pass as a \"tablet\" app. Do a couple of bits of tablet optimisation and you've - arguably - finished. Apple makes you go the extra mile, and the user benefits.</p><p>Windows 8's graphical layout subsystem (Windows Presentation Foundation, or WPF) is roughly analogous to Android's, so it may be that porting apps will yield the same \"meh\" result as on Android. </p><p>The result is what I call a \"balance of the universe\" problem - you don't get something for nothing. The iPad implementation has had more energy put into it. The amount of love and tradecraft is going to show in the finished product. It typically does with an Android app.</p><p>Windows Phone to Windows 8 Metro-style ports lie on this same \"risk vector\". Windows 8 devs will be able to happy slap a Windows Phone app over to Windows 8 with little effort, just like the Android guys and gals. This opens up the platform to the same \"it's just a bunch of ported phone apps\" criticisms. That said, a wrinkle for Windows 8 lies in the fact that a lot of developers haven't got to the new platform yet, and the Windows Phone and Windows 8 toolsets are not harmonised. The trick would therefore be to get the ecosystem booted from new, non-phone developers, and non-phone apps. In trying to create an iPad competitor, I personally feel that avoiding the pull towards \"start with a phone and scale up\" can only help. Post-PC devices are not big phones. All of us involved in software engineering needs to understand this.</p><p>One thing that I am confident about is that the volume of apps will get there on Windows 8. Go back five years and most professional developers would greet any developer who used Cocoa, Objective-C, and Xcode with equal measures of condescension and patronisation. A lot of developers out there are now waiting for Windows 8 to happen, although admittedly a lot of them may not know it yet. Plus there's all the <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/03/20/android_interest_slipping/\">Android developers who may be falling out of love with the platform</a>. </p><h2>OEMs need to up their game</h2><p>It wasn't my intention to look into the hardware, but it's worth having a look at the Acer tablet I bought. There are some warning indicators to OEMs building WOA tablets.</p><p>My (Intel-based) Acer cost £365 including VAT and shipping. The (ARM-based) iPad 2 costs £329 including VAT and shipping. </p><p>Ignoring the size and weight difference - the x86 processor architecture makes demands of the Acer's cooling and battery that the iPad doesn't have to - the Acer is cheap and plasticky. It flexes and creaks on the axis. After a week and a bit of light use, the back is scratched to bits, as is the front screen, which is plastic as opposed to Corning's <a href=\"http://home.howstuffworks.com/gorilla-glass-used-in-an-ipad.htm\">Gorilla Glass</a>. (The screen's robustness so below par that I'm planning on sending this unit back.) The iPad is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipophobicity\">oleophobic</a>; the Acer definitely is not. It's a dreary lump of a thing - the worst possible example of bottom-line driven, box shifting laziness that OEMs can achieve. A tick in the box with no love or craft whatsoever.</p><p>If OEMs put out WOA units like this, just forget it. Dump your MSFT stock and move on because it'll be game over.</p><p>It doesn't have to be like this though. The new <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrabook\">Ultrabook-specification</a> laptops are really rather good. (Ultrabooks are an Intel-driven scheme to brand OEM laptops with a spec that happens to compete with the MacBook Air.) Ultrabooks are built with a metal chassis, and typically (should) have a capacitive, multitouch screen. Some are properly gorgeous. They are an example of what OEMs can do when sufficiently motivated. </p><p>So all the OEMs need to do is not create the dross like my current Windows tablet and instead build something like an Ultrabook, but in iPad form, for less money than an iPad. And with better battery life. And lighter. And with a retina screen. And make sure the retina screen doesn't adversely affect battery life. Or make it heavy.</p><h2>Shutting down</h2><p>Just because this came up, let's deal with this: Windows 8 is dead easy to shut down. Swipe from the right to bring up the charms, select Settings, Power, Shut down. I'm all for curmudgeonlyness and being a stick-in-the-mud, but there was been some ridiculous content written about this \"problem\" for weeks, including this <a href=\"http://www.infoworld.com/t/microsoft-windows/windows-8-shutdown-made-easy-way-of-microsoft-189541\">slightly barking piece</a>. (By the way, that approach outlined in that article certainly won't work on WOA devices.) Windows 8 shutdown mechanism is the pinnacle of ease of use when it comes to restarting Windows. Can we just learn it and move on? Please?</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>After using a Windows 8 tablet for a week, the takeaway message is: it works. It does what an iPad does, essentially as well as an iPad does. It's actually hard to get hold of what that actually means, or what it feels like - but then that's rather than point. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/mar/16/windows-8-metro-tablet\">The idea of these devices is to get out of the way and let you connect to people who are important to you</a>, and my limited experiment has shown that even on crappy hardware you can run today, Windows 8 lets you do this in a way that's more than just \"acceptable\". </p><p>What you can do today with Windows 8 on a tablet is actually kinda fun to use and - assuming the marketing and app support isn't a total balls-up - should give us the competitor to the iPad that we need in the industry.</p><p><em>Matthew Baxter-Reynolds is an independent software development consultant, trainer and author based in the UK.

        "body":"<p>At 2.20am on Sunday, 1,309 passengers aboard MS Balmoral on the Titanic Memorial Cruise will be at the very spot the White Star Line's \"unsinkable ship\" sank 100 years ago. Among those re-creating the journey, and the atmosphere prior to the tragedy, is Patricia Watt, 81, a retired teacher from Bristol, travelling with her husband, David, 80, and who hopes to find \"closure\" at a simple onboard service to commemorate the 1,514 who died.</p><p>\"My grandfather, on my mother's side, was a steward on the Titanic. He was second class steward George MacKie, aged 34, from Southampton. And he went down with the ship.</p><p>\"It wasn't something we talked about early on. My grandmother was left with three young children to bring up, so it took a while before we knew much about it.</p><p>\"I just thought, being here and doing this, would be closure for my family, because my grandmother was never able, obviously, to hold a funeral service for her husband.</p><p>\"I've brought a photograph of him with me, because there may be people on board who wish to know what he was like.</p><p>\"I saw the advert for the cruise about two or three years ago. I'd always wanted to do something to acknowledge my grandfather, and I was very pleased there would be the opportunity to visit the wreck site.</p><p>\"There are quite a few people on board who have family links. We are all sharing our experiences and family histories. It's not sadness so much as having something in common with other passengers. That's been quite important.</p><p>\"There's something like 44 people who are descendants. And there are people who have taken an interest in the Titanic over many years. On the whole, those on board are people who have a very strong interest either through family or through studying what happened.</p><p>\"It's a very friendly atmosphere. You start talking to other passengers and asking them why they are here, which is perhaps something you wouldn't normally do on a cruise. And I've found others who have very similar stories to mine.</p><p>\"There are some fantastic outfits. Some people have gone to great lengths - wonderful hats and dresses and clothes from the Edwardian era. It's fun. I've not done a great deal, but everyone is trying to get into what the atmosphere would have been like, obviously, prior to things going wrong. People are entering into the spirit. I've brought formal evening wear \u2013 I've got a long dress and jacket. And a tiara, though not a real one. I've also got a fur stole, just to be a little bit elegant, as they would have been.</p><p>\"Each evening there is always one dish available that would have been served on the Titanic. Last night it was chicken and rice, which would have been served to second class passengers. The first night there was cabbage with cheese sauce, which was on the original menu.</p><p>\"And the music is also what would have been played on board. The musicians are dressed in the evening suits that the orchestra would have worn on the White Star Line.</p><p>\"I've spent the days going to some very enjoyable talks about the Titanic by people who have done a lot of research. One was by a great granddaughter of one of the passengers, and another by a grandson of a steward who had survived.</p><p>\"I think what has surprised me, the more I've learned, is the distinction between the classes.

        "body":"<p>Mitt Romney had had a long and uneasy relationship with the gun lobby but he will try to overcome that on Friday afternoon when he addresses the annual conference of the National Rifle Association in St Louis in the hope of unlocking tens of millions of dollars for his White House campaign. </p><p>His speech will be a difficult balancing act, being delivered against the backdrop of the Trayvon Martin shooting and the 'stand-your-ground' laws which the NRA is championing.</p><p>Romney is seeking the financial backing of an organisation that in the past has devoted $20m to $30m in supporting presidential candidates. At the same time, he has to be careful to avoid alienating the large swathe of people uneasy over the stand-your-ground laws in Florida and elsewhere in America in the light of the Martin shooting.</p><p>Although Barack Obama has made no significant move against existing gun laws, the NRA does not trust him and is planning to campaign against him in the November election. The NRA leadership has already said it plans to support Romney.</p><p>Normally a trip to the NRA is an easy one for a prospective Republican president but Romney's position on guns, like his position on health reform, is ambiguous.</p><p>Many of the NRA's 4 million members, interviewed by various media outlets in the run-up to the St Louis conference, have expressed suspicion and distrust over Romney's record on gun laws and are not reassured by his claims that to be a 'hunter'.</p><p>Romney so far has had little to say about Trayvon Martin and stand your ground, restricting himself to a short statement describing his death as a tragedy and calling last month for \"a thorough investigation\" to reassure the public that justice was being done impartially.</p><p>Part of the suspicion of Romney can be traced back to his failed campaign for the Senate in 1994 in liberal Massachusetts where he supported the Brady Bill, which places curbs on gun sales and assault weapons. He also boasted at the time of his independence from the NRA. \"I don't line up with the NRA,\" he said.</p><p>As governor of Massachusetts, he pledged to do nothing to reverse the state's relatively tough gun laws. The NRA withheld its endorsement of him during his campaign for the governorship.</p><p>In the run-up to his  2008 bid for the Republican presidential nomination, Romney said he was a member of the NRA: true, but papers showed he had joined only months before joining the campaign trail. He said he was a gun owner, but the gun in question belonged to one of his son's. He also insisted he was a hunter, though he had only been out twice. He has since made further trips, however.</p><p>The NRA says it plans to spend more in advertising and other campaign than previous presidential elections.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Mitt+Romney&k=US+gun+control&k=US+politics&k=US+elections+2012&k=Republicans&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mitt+Romney+to+deliver+NRA+speech+in+hopes+of+securing+campaign+cash+Article+1731071&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Mitt+Romney+%28News%29%2CGun+control+%28US%29%2CUS+politics%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CRepublicans+%28US%29%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news%2CNRA+%28National+Rifle+Association%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill&c7=12-Apr-13&c8=1731071&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/13/mitt-romney-nra-speech-st-louis|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|c0b9f1930e99ece6c9945b78980e15eacb3bf36d -->",

Wright is a fascinating example of what makes this city's art scene distinctive, and part of the interest is that he is an <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/richard-wright\" title=\"\">adoptive, not born, Glaswegian</a>. He <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correcto\" title=\"\">plays in a band</a>, which typifies the mixture of pop culture and art that has characterised Glasgow's visual creativity since <a href=\"http://arts.guardian.co.uk/pictures/image/0,8543,-11004531576,00.html\" title=\"\">Douglas Gordon</a> recorded the music playing when he was in the womb. He draws on sources that range from heavy metal album covers to <a href=\"http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/durr/hd_durr.htm\" title=\"\">Albrecht Dürer</a>. Yet his work lacks ego and refuses to impose itself, consisting of abstract drawings and temporary installations that may have the beauty of Renaissance frescoes but rarely the longevity. An exception is his fine <a href=\"http://www.nationalgalleries.org/collection/the-stairwell-project/19369/19400\" title=\"\">Stairwell Project at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art</a> over in Edinburgh, which is also well worth checking out if you are travelling to Scotland for the art festival.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.glasgowinternational.org/index.php/events/view/richard_wright_at_kelvingrove/\" title=\"\">Kelvingrove Art Gallery</a>, from 20 April until 24 June</p><h2>Also opening this week</h2><p><strong>Paul Thek</strong><br />Organic conceptualism, a more carnal version of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/andywarhol\" title=\"\">Warhol</a> and Duchamp.<br /><a href=\"http://www.themoderninstitute.com/\" title=\"\">Modern Institute</a>, Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art, from 20 April until 2 June</p><p><strong>Michael Wilkinson</strong><br />A piece called Dresden by an artist with a feel for history and political memory.<br /><a href=\"http://www.glasgowinternational.org/index.php/events/view/michaelwilkinson/\" title=\"\">Modern Institute</a>, Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art, 20 April until 7 May</p><p><strong>Matthew Monahan</strong><br />Shards of modern stuff congeal in uneasy figurations in the work of this American artist.<br /><a href=\"http://www.modernart.net/\" title=\"\">Stuart Shave/Modern Art</a>, London from 13 April until 12 May</p><p><strong>Allotment</strong><br />Artists and curators cultivate their own plots as art through the spring and summer.<br /><a href=\"http://www.macarts.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Mac</a>, Birmingham until 9 September</p><h2>Masterpiece of the week</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/paul-cezanne-self-portrait\" title=\"\">Paul Cézanne, Self-Portrait, c1880-1881</a></p><p>No one had ever scrutinised himself in quite the same way that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/cezanne\" title=\"\">Cézanne</a> does in this modern masterpiece. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rembrandts-Eyes-Allen-Lane-History/dp/0140288414/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334239072&amp;sr=8-1\" title=\"\">Rembrandt looked himself in the eye and found a humanist monument to age and experience</a>. But Cézanne sees something else. He sees a face, but what is a face? What is an individual? The way his fractured, hesitant marks speckle the surface of the painting conveys deep uncertainty about his own selfhood.

Maybe I'll never get to it now. But you know when you go into an Apple Store, and it's filled with sometimes scary Apple fanatics who seem to have arrived at a holy place? That's Google+ for Google.</p><p> If Google+ isn't anything else, it's a place that Google fans can call home. It's a place that Google's never really had before, a spot for its millions (and let's face it, there are millions) of fanboys and fangirls to rejoice in all things Google.</p><p> I've experienced this firsthand in my time at Google. I've learned that if I share anything negative about Google, I can expect to get comments, sometimes many, asking why I hate Google or am biased against Google.</p></blockquote><p> Sullivan generally writes positively about Google, and you can see how wrestling with his dislike of its slipperiness over Google+.

If you have more accurate information, please leave a comment and I'll fix it.</p></blockquote><p> Upshot: Instagram is a long way from being the most expensive purchase on a per-user basis from the past 13 years. To repeat: Instagram isn't the purchase that marks the top of the bubble. It's part of the bubble.</p><h2><a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5242\">About Java for OS X Lion 2012-003 &gt;&gt; Apple</a></h2><blockquote><p>This Java security update removes the most common variants of the Flashback malware.</p><p> This update also configures the Java web plug-in to disable the automatic execution of Java applets.

I saw that some of the smaller defendants, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/gedeon/status/190541152125059073\">including Iconfactory</a>, settled the dispute on undisclosed terms, presumably because they couldn't afford the cost and deal with risk of protracted litigation. I wish the remaining defendants as well as all those facing the threat of being sued that Apple's intervention will help to get his troll defeated. I also hope that <a href=\"http://www.fosspatents.com/2011/08/googles-reexamination-requests-against.html\">Google's reexamination requests</a> will be successful.

        "body":"<p>Foreign ministers from the world's leading industrial countries ended a two-day meeting in Washington expressing a joint determination to see international peace monitors deployed in Syria as fast as possible to observe the shaky ceasefire.</p><p>Although the G8 foreign ministers' summit discussed issues from the weekend nuclear talks with Iran to the imminent launch of a North Korean long-range missile, ministers devoted most of it to the clashes in Syria that have left an estimated 9,000 dead.</p><p>The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, noted that the ceasefire negotiated by the former United Nations secretary-general, Kofi Annan, appeared to be holding, adding pointedly: \"At least for the moment\".</p><p>Ministers expressed concern that the tentative ceasefire might collapse before any significant moves, chiefly the deployment of monitors, are taken. </p><p>\"If it holds, a ceasefire is an important step, but it represents just one element of the special envoy's plan,\" Clinton told reporters at a state department press conference at the end of the summit. If monitors are in place, the next step would be the withdrawal of Syrian government forces from cities where rebels have strongholds and eventually a political settlement.</p><p>The foreign ministers from G8 \u2013 made up of the US, Russia, Japan, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and and Italy \u2013 met in Washington to lay the ground for a meeting of G8 leaders at Camp David next month.</p><p>Before the foreign ministers gathered, one of the main worries of diplomats from the US and Europe was how to keep Russia on board. Russia, a long-time ally of Syria, has repeatedly blocked moves by the UN security council against Syrian president Bashar Assad. But Russia has signed up to Annan's peace plan, and the other seven G8 countries held it to those pledges.</p><p>Clinton met on the sidelines with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, specifically on Syria.</p><p>At the press conference, Clinton warned Assad against failure to implement the plan in full. \"The Annan plan is not a menu of options. It is a set of obligations,\" she said. \"The burden of fully and visibly meeting all of these obligations continues to rest with the regime. They cannot pick and choose.</p><p>For it to be meaningful, this apparent halt in violence must lead to a credible political process and a peaceful, inclusive democratic transition.\"</p><p>The Obama administration's line on Syria goes further than either the G8 nor the UN by calling on Assad to stand down. \"We remain firmly resolved that the regime's war against its own people must end for good and political transition must begin,\" Clinton said. \"Assad will have to go and the Syrian people must be given the chance to chart their own future.\"</p><p>Another pressing issue, unable to wait until the full G8 meets next month,  is North Korea. Diplomats warned that it would be \"inadvisable\" for North Korea to launch, as planned, its long-range missile as this would renew tensions on the Korean peninsula.</p><p>\"We urge the North Korean leadership to honour its agreements and refrain from pursuing a cycle of provocation,\" Clinton said.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Syria&k=Hillary+Clinton&k=G8&k=World+news&k=United+Nations&k=US+foreign+policy\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Hillary+Clinton+and+G8+ministers%3A+peace+monitors+must+be+sent+to+Syria+Article+1730750&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Syria+%28News%29%2CHillary+Clinton+%28News%29%2CG8+%28News%29%2CWorld+news%2CUnited+Nations+%28News%29%2CUS+foreign+policy%2CUS+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730750&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/12/hillary-clinton-g8-peace-monitors-syria|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|5a20b8892e8953417235c85cba1f0a913307d949 -->",

        "body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.00am:</span> Good morning and welcome to our live blog politics coverage! Tom McCarthy here in New York and here's where things stand:</p><p><strong>\u2022 A televised remark by a Democratic strategist that Ann Romney, the wife of Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney and mother of his five children, has \"never worked a day in her life\" has created a cyclone of indignation.</strong> Ann Romney started a Twitter account and said raising five kids was work, thank you very much. The Obama campaign is on the defensive.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work.</p><p>\u2014 Ann Romney (@AnnDRomney) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnDRomney/status/190262588163100672\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T02:18:30+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><p>\u2022 <strong>Ann Romney will appear on television soon to talk about her husband's plan for women and the economy, and to discuss the remarks of the Democratic strategist, Hilary Rosen</strong>. The kerfuffle follows a Washington Post/ABC News poll earlier this week showing Obama with a 19-point lead over Romney among women.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>The Obama campaign has produced a video marking the sixth anniversary of Mitt Romney's Massachusetts health care plan, signed into law on April 12, 2006.</strong> This is an attempt to preempt attacks on Obama's health care plan. We'll post the video momentarily.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>President Obama will honor NASCAR champ Tony Stewart and other drivers in a White House ceremony. </strong>Will Danica Patrick be there? And will there be photos?</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.28am:</span> My colleague Ryan Devereaux has been looking into the Rosen brouhaha in more depth.</p><p>Barack Obama's senior advisers went into damage control mode immediately after Hilary Rosen's CNN appearance last night, with campaign manager <strong>Jim Messina</strong> and top strategist <strong>David Axelrod</strong> both taking to Twitter.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I could not disagree with Hilary Rosen any more strongly.

When asked about Romney's position on the act in a conference call on Wednesday, his top policy aides seemed unsure how to respond. The law is opposed by elements of the conservative base Romney seeks to please. The Romney campaign eventually released a statement saying he supports the radical notion of pay equity. The Democrats wasted no time in seizing on the opportunity to release citing Ledbetter's \"shocked and disappointed\" reaction to the controversy.</p><p>Romney's strategy for taking the president to task on women's issues includes arguing that women have suffered disproportionately under current White House policies, particularly in terms of job losses. </p><p>On Tuesday and Wednesday the former governor repeatedly cited the figure 92.3% figure, which he says it represents women's share of all the jobs lost since the president's inauguration in January 2009. But it turns out that's not quite accurate. Though women have lost a considerable number of jobs in the last three years, men lost way more during the recession (which officially began in December 2007). Men are also prone to work in sectors that are vulnerable swings in the business cycle.</p><p>Romney's advisers on women's issues include <strong>Bay Buchanan,</strong> sister of paleoconservative Pat Buchanan. Like her brother, Buchanan is known for making incendiary assertions. Among her more controversial statements are the suggestion that the nation's \"social decay\" is the result of the feminist movement, that feminism is rooted in fundamental failures (women don't value marriage and can only be happy outside the home, the sexual revolution made free-loving \"alley cats\" out of women and the defense of abortion, for example) and breast cancer may be the result of past abortions.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.57am:</span> <strong>Ann Romney</strong> has just appeared on Fox News to talk about Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen's comments, and she turns in an upbeat, on-point appearance. She's asked for her gut reaction to Rosen's comments. It turns out she's no more given to moments of nasty passion than her husband.</p><p>\"She should have come to my house when those five boys were causing so much trouble,\" Romney laughs. \"It wasn't so easy.\"</p><p>Then she pivots into her larger point, that one way is not better than another. \"We need to respect the choices that women make. We have to respect women in all those choices they make. \u2026 And we have to give a shout-out to all the dads who are at home raising kids.\"</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.05am:</span> More from <strong>Ann Romney's Fox News appearance.</strong> Her job here is to show her husband as a man who respects and loves his wife and holds women in general in high regard. </p><p>She accomplishes this by saying so, and also by coming across as a frank, intelligent, relatable (!) woman who we can guess would pick well in choosing a mate.</p><p>\"I will tell you that Mitt said to me more times than you can imagine: 'Ann your job is more important than mine,'\" she says. \"By the way, Mitt respects women that make those different choices. He listens to a lot of different women.\"</p><p>Then Romney shifts to her campaign boilerplate, the part where she is a mouthpiece for women across the country:</p><p>\"I want to tell you what women are telling me. Guess what women are talking about? Guess what? They're talking about jobs, and they're talking about the legacy of debt that we're leaving our children. That's what we're hearing. And that's what they're talking about here.\"</p><p>More effective is Romney's answer to Rosen's assertion that staying at home was her choice and she never had to worry about money.</p><p>\"I know what it's like to struggle,\" the breast cancer survivor says. \"Maybe I haven't struggled as much financially as some people have. But I can tell you that I have had struggle in my life. Mitt and I have compassion for people who are struggling. And that's why we're running.\" She comes across as sincere. She's helping her husband here.</p><p>Ann Romney shares this, however, with her husband: Even when she's being sincere, the language she uses is sometimes so artless \u2013 so tinny, so evocative of a computer programmed to carry on conversation \u2013 that it rings false:</p><p>\"You should see how many women he listens to. That's what I love about Mitt. There are so many around him who he respects and admires.... Mitt Romney is a person that admires women and listens to them. And I am grateful that he listens to me and what I am telling him about what women are facing right now.\"</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.17am:</span> Is the <strong>Hillary Rosen scandal</strong> a tempest in a teapot? Is this all just Republicans making hay of an innocuous lapse of speech by a political commentator? Or do Rosen's comments expose a real insensitivity among Democrats to the \"traditional\" family \u2013 or a point of conflict between two political philosophies? </p><p>For the record here's what Rosen said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>With respect to economic issues, I think actually that Mitt Romney is right that ultimately women care more about the economic well-being of their family and the like.  But he doesn't connect on that issue, either.  What you have is Mitt Romney running around the country saying well, you know, my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues, and when I listen to my wife, that's what I'm hearing.  Guess what?  His wife has actually never worked a day in her life.  She's never really dealt with the kinds of economic issues that a majority of the women in this country are facing in terms of how do we feed our kids, how do we send them to school, and why we worry about their future.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Let us know in the comments and later we'll discuss the most level-headed and incisive analyses.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.26am:</span> We're about five minutes away from a <strong>Romney campaign conference call</strong> on how the president's economy policies are \"failing women.\" Participating will be Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Rep. Cynthia Lummis. </p><p>How will the legislators make the case that President Obama is hurting women? Let's listen in!</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.45am:</span> Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) begins the <strong>Romney conference call</strong> by saying Hilary Rosen's comment was \"insulting.\" Ayotte has two kids. </p><p>\"Women have faced massive job losses under this administration,\" Ayotte says. \"I'm really worried about what we're leaving for the next generation in terms of the massive debt we've incurred under this president. ... I know that women, myself included, are concerned about what we're leaving for children.\"</p><p>There is an accidental conflict between the points the Romney camp is making this morning. Those points are: one, it's insulting to say that staying at home doesn't count as work. Two, not enough women are able to get jobs outside the home.</p><p>Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers on now. She says the \"war on women\" supposedly being waged by Republicans is a myth, the creation of the Democrats. \"What's really going on is a war on reality by the Democrats,\" she says.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.49am:</span> Waiting for someone on the <strong>Romney conference call</strong> to name an Obama policy that has hurt women's economic prospects. They're holding him responsible for jobs lost during the recession. That's an argument to be made. But it's a leap from there to get to \"Obama has been bad for women.\"</p><p>The argument the Obama camp has to make, that Romney's policies are antagonistic to women, is more concrete. Romney supports the overturning of Roe v. Wade. He wants to abolish Planned Parenthood. And he doesn't want employers to be required to cover contraception as part of their health insurance.</p><p>Those issues aren't the most important for every women voter. But they're part of the reason for that double-digit gap between the president and Romney among women.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.58am:</span> Let's drop <strong>that call</strong> for a moment (a moment that lasts forever). The point participants are making is that what Democratic adviser Hilary Rosen said about Ann Romney not working was offensive. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I apparently am on the \"Hillary Rosen speaks for Barack Obama\" conference call.</p><p>\u2014 John Dickerson (@johndickerson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johndickerson/status/190467800144429056\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T15:53:56+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><!-- Block 10 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.04pm:</span> Former Republican primary frontrunner <strong>Herman Cain</strong> is still making commercials, and they're still gonzo.

The Obama strategy in the general election is to paint Romney as a benighted conservative whom no Independent in his/her right mind would vote for. Highlighting Romney's moderate record as governor would be counterproductive. So the thinking went.</p><p>As if on cue, the Obama camp has released a three-minute video commemorating Romney's work on his state health care law.</p><p>The video depicts Romney as having executed an astoundingly brash about-face on health care reform. The MIT expert who helped write both laws is interviewed. Others express disbelief that the candidate has changed his tune so dramatically.</p><p>Maybe the Obama camp can make both arguments at once. Romney is an arch-conservative. He is also a political opportunist. Apparently the president's reelection campaign has decided the messages work together.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.45pm:</span> <strong>Mitt Romney</strong> has said again and again on the stump that he gleans special insight into the hearts and minds of women voters through the faithful reports of his wife, Ann, after she speaks with them. </p><p>Some find the assertion to be balanced on a knife edge between absurd and sexist.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Also, because I can't get over this, please imagine female candidate saying, \"My husband talks to men and tells me about their concerns.\"</p><p>\u2014 Kate Harding (@KateHarding) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KateHarding/status/190447334591696896\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T14:32:37+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><!-- Block 15 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.13pm:</span> <strong>From the comments</strong> (where we have invited you to take the measure of Rosengate, which you were going to anyway): A point by bloopie2:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/75056.html\">Politico has an article by John F. Harris, </a>noting that both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are \"exceptionally self-contained, self-disciplined, self-motivated\" men, whose minds \"gravitate to rationality and logic\u2014both of whom have expressed disdain for the disorder and surliness that pervade modern governance.\" </p><p>His point, it seems, is that for all the bombast and extremism of the current electoral process, come January we will have a President who is neither bombastic nor extreme (in many ways, not all, obviously). On the other hand, some of the Presidents he cites who are not like O and Mitt (Clinton, Johnson) were quite effective in their own ways.</p></blockquote><p>A point well made. One of the sharpest contrasts between the Obama presidency and that of George W. Bush has been in the leaders' rhetorical styles. Where Bush could be pugnacious, Obama projects tranquility; where Bush used the language of \"us vs. them,\" Obama talks a lot of kumbaya. Yet the tenor of national politics has not leavened under Obama. We still all hate each other, it seems. </p><p>The conclusion being that the president does not set the tone of the national politics. The question then being: who does?</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.37pm:</span> CNN reports that <strong>Hilary Rosen</strong> has taken a hitherto unprecedented step in the long saga of her remarks disparaging Ann Romney and their fallout: She has apologized.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Rosen: \"I apologize to Ann Romney and anyone else who was offended. \"Live with @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wolfblitzercnn\">wolfblitzercnn</a> today on @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNNSitRoom\">CNNSitRoom</a> 4p-6p.</p><p>\u2014 Patricia DiCarlo (@pdicarlocnn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pdicarlocnn/status/190493199595352065\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T17:34:52+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><p>So this means it's all over with, right?</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.36pm:</span> Now for today's most likeable, un-likeliest of stories: <strong>Newt Gingrich and Fox News</strong> are at war over the channel's coverage of the candidate.

My colleague Ewen MacAskill <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/apr/12/newt-gingrich-complains-fox-news\">has the rundown</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Fox News has attacked the struggling Republican presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich, after an outburst in which he blamed the network for the failure of his campaign and claimed it was biased in favour of Mitt Romney.</p><p>A spokesman for the Fox News Channel, where Gingrich had a contract before hitting the campaign trail, dismissed the accusations and claimed his criticism of the network was motivated by a desire for a job at rival CNN.</p><p>Gingrich's outspoken criticism of Fox came at a meeting in Delaware on Wednesday with Tea Party activists.</p><p>According to the RealClearPolitics website, which was given access to the meeting, Gingrich said: \"I think Fox has been for Romney all the way through. In our experience, Callista and I both believe CNN is less biased than Fox this year.</p><p>\"We are more likely to get neutral coverage out of CNN than we are of Fox, and we're more likely to get distortion out of Fox. That's just a fact.\"</p><p>Fox hit back in a strongly personal attack.

Are there any <em>presidents</em> in the audience? Wait, you there, down in front with the double-digit lead among women voters in the 2012 presidential race according to a recent ABC News poll. <strong>Barack Obama</strong>!</p><p>The president took a question about Rosen-gate today from Bruce Aune of ABC's Cedar Rapids affiliate KCRG. <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/obama-rejects-rosens-comments-on-ann-romney/\">Mary Bruce</a> writes up the interview. <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/obama-rejects-rosens-comments-on-ann-romney/\">Click through</a> to check out the video. Here's what the president said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Here's what I know. That there's no tougher job than being a mom. And, when I think about what Michelle's had to do, and when I think about my own mom, a single mother raising me and my sister, that's work. And so anybody who would argue otherwise probably needs to rethink their statement.</p><p>More broadly, I don't have a lot of patience for commentary about the spouses of political candidates. My general view is, those of us in public life, we're fair game. Our families are civilians. I haven't met Mrs. Romney, but she seems like a very nice women who's supportive of her family and supportive of her husband. I don't know that she volunteered for this job, so, you know, we don't need to be directing comments at them. I think me and Governor Romney are going to have more than enough to argue about over the course of this campaign.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 27 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">5.51pm:</span> We're going to call it a wrap on today's <strong>politics live blog</strong>; may we express our appreciation for your attention and input. Here's what happened:</p><p>\u2022 <strong>The trespasses of Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist, took over the national political discourse like a giant viscous blob of green God-knows-what.</strong> What did she do wrong? We're not even sure anymore. Did she say she was sorry? We earnestly believe that she did.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Ann Romney acquitted herself nicely, in our judgment, in an appearance on Fox News in which she spoke of her husband Mitt Romney's respect for women </strong>and lifelong habit of seeking their good counsel. She also opened <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/AnnDRomney\">a Twitter account </a>which has now racked up 25,519 followers after only two Tweets. Those are Sheen numbers. </p><p>\u2022<strong> The gender gap in salaries and employment in America is shrinking, my colleague Dominic Rushe noted.</strong> Last month, the unemployment rate was 8.3% for men and 8.1% for women. In 1979, women ages 25 to 34 earned 68% what their male counterparts did. By 2010, they earned 91%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Not there yet, employers.</p><p>\u2022 <strong>Newt Gingrich and Fox News got into a slapfight that we fear cannot but end unprettily.</strong> Gingrich said Fox was about as fair and balanced as a two-legged stool (to paraphrase). Fox said Newt was just trying out for a CNN job.

        "headline":"A week in radio",
        "body":"<p>\"It's been 40 years since I had a No 1 hit&nbsp;with Puppy Love,\" <strong>Donny Osmond</strong> told listeners to his new Sunday night show on <a href=\"http://www.smoothradio.co.uk/shows-presenters/donny-osmond-on-sunday-evenings/1eb4d\" title=\"Smooth Radio\">Smooth Radio</a>. Before playing the track, he recalled singing the song live on stage in the early days: \"The girls started screaming and I forgot the&nbsp;words.\"</p><p>The four-hour show from Las Vegas could do with a little more of this layer of him reminiscing about his career. Otherwise, it's several relaxed tracks played back to back, with gaps so long between Donny's links that you start wondering what on earth he might be doing during the music, and a smattering of slightly odd entertainment stories. The first was Kate Winslet's reaction (\"Make it stop! Make it stop!\") on seeing herself in 3D in Titanic.</p><p>Musically, the show suits its slot (8pm-midnight) with its easy-going classics, and Donny is certainly smooth enough to feel at home on the station. \"I beat Celine Dion as best singer in Las Vegas,\" he said of a recent award before playing some Dion. He talked about a Chinese fad for pillow fights to de-stress, then pretended to write \"Marie\" on a pillowcase (\"Hey, Marie, can I see you for a minute?\"). It's all very slickly done, but more chat from Donny would improve things. One unintended giggle: the commercial break after Puppy Love featured a rather neatly placed ad for dog food.</p><p><strong>Annie Nightingale's </strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01fcnhh\" title=\"Eternal Jukebox\"><strong>Eternal Jukebox</strong></a> (Radio 2), a one-off show for Easter Monday, was a far livelier affair, crackling with fidgety energy. \"Hello, hi, hey!\" said Nightingale after the opening track: Killer Queen. From there, she explained, the idea was that each track would spark a connection from \"the jukebox in my head\". The result was a meander through beautiful music \u2013 Prefab Spout, This Mortal Coil, Ian Dury, Fleetwood Mac, Bob Marley \u2013 yoked together with much style and verve by Nightingale. It was a huge treat for those of us who grew up listening to her Sunday night show, but who aren't majorly drawn to the grime and dubstep she plays on Radio 1.

        "headline":"Fox News hits back at 'bitter' Newt Gingrich over claims of campaign bias",
        "body":"<p>Fox News has attacked the struggling Republican presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich, after an outburst in which he blamed the network for the failure of his campaign and claimed it was biased in favour of Mitt Romney.</p><p>The channel, where Gingrich had a contract before hitting the campaign trail, dismissed the accusations and claimed his criticism of the network was motivated by a desire for a job at rival CNN.</p><p>Gingrich's outspoken criticism of Fox came at a meeting in Delaware on Wednesday with Tea Party activists.<br /><a href=\" http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/04/12/gingrich_unloads_on_fox_news_in_private_meeting___113818.html\"><br />According to the RealClearPolitics website</a>, which was given access to the meeting, Gingrich said: \"I think Fox has been for Romney all the way through. In our experience, Callista and I both believe CNN is less biased than Fox this year.</p><p>\"We are more likely to get neutral coverage out of CNN than we are of Fox, and we're more likely to get distortion out of Fox. That's just a fact.\"</p><p>Fox hit back in a strongly personal attack. In a statement provided to the Guardian, it said: \"This is nothing other than Newt auditioning for a windfall of a gig at CNN \u2013 that's the kind of man he is. Not to mention that he's still bitter about the fact that we terminated his contributor contract.\"</p><p>While Gingrich has chosen to remain in the Republican race after the exit of Rick Santorum on Tuesday, he has won only two states so far and is trailing well behind Romney. He is also struggling financially, having accumulated huge debts during the campaign and suffered the indignity of seeing a $500 cheque to the Utah Republican party bounce.</p><p>Gingrich is campaigning this week in Delaware, one of several states where he hopes he can benefit from Santorum's departure.</p><p>At the Delaware meeting, he said he was working on the assumption that Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, Fox's parent company, had thrown his support behind Romney.</p><p>\"I assume it's because Murdoch at some point  said, 'I want Romney', and so 'fair and balanced' became 'Romney'. And there's no question that Fox had a lot to do with stopping my campaign because such a high percentage of our base watches Fox.\"</p><p>Fox, led by Roger Ailes, has been the main media forum for the Republican candidates. Fox insists it has been fair and balanced. In the initial stages of the primary and caucus season, it even seemed to be more hostile toward Romney than the other candidates. But by March, Santorum was complaining, on Fox, about bias.</p><p>Santorum said Romney enjoyed a huge advantage in terms of money, organisation and media coverage. \"He's had Fox News shilling for him every day,\" Santorum said.</p><p>Gingrich is to attend the White House correspondents' dinner at the end of the month, but as a guest of CNN, not Fox. He insisted he was largely indifferent to the views of journalists: \"They know I don't care about their opinions. I don't go to their cocktail parties. I don't go to their Christmas parties. The only press events I go to are interesting dinners when the wife insists on it, so we're going to go to the White House correspondents' dinner because she wants to. And we're actually going to go to CNN's table, not Fox.\"</p><p>He expressed disappointment that former colleagues Fox, with whom he had a contract until he officially joined the Republican race, had apparently written him off last summer.</p><p>Gingrich enjoyed massive media coverage when he won the South Carolina primary in January, but interest dipped after he failed to win Florida the same month. Since then, coverage has gradually evaporated, with no print journalists any longer attached full-time to coverage of his campaign. </p><p>In the meeting in Delaware, according to the RealClearPolitics report, he expanded his criticism of the media beyond Fox, in particular columnist George Will, whom he accused of personal jealousy.</p><p>\"In the case of Will, I was on [George] Stephanopoulos on Sunday morning with him, and it was kind of a 'You're not allowed to run for office \u2013 I mean, if you could run for office, why am I not running for office?' \" Gingrich said. \"And it's almost like they were personally offended. You know, 'This can't be real', and 'How can this guy go do that?'</p><p>\"I got that reaction from Will a few years back about writing a book, because I'm supposed to be a politician. He's supposed to be the writer. Well, I've now written 24 books, and 13 of them are New York Times bestsellers. I mean, there's a morning when George ought to just get over it.\"</p><p>As well as criticising the media, Gingrich attacked the Republican party, describing it as \"inarticulate\". He added: \"The Republican party is a managerial party that doesn't like to fight, doesn't like to read books.\"</p><p>He described Delaware as his best chance of a win on April 24.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Newt+Gingrich&k=Fox+News&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&k=US+elections+2012&k=United+States&k=US+politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Fox+News+hits+back+at+%27bitter%27+Newt+Gingrich+over+claims+of+campaign+bias+Article+1730661&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Newt+Gingrich%2CFox+News%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CUS+politics%2CCNN%2CMedia%2CRupert+Murdoch+%28Media%29%2CRepublicans+%28US%29%2CNews+Corporation+%28Media%29%2CTea+Party+movement%2CDelaware+%28News%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730661&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/12/newt-gingrich-complains-fox-news|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|cb66f837373c1d896d1b990ffe798a1fe55ce578 -->",

        "body":"<p>The Metropolitan police chief has been summoned to parliament to give evidence about the growing racism scandal in the force, which has resulted in a string of inquiries involving almost 20 officers.</p><p>Bernard Hogan-Howe will be cross-examined by MPs on Tuesday about the mounting claims of prejudiced behaviour which have so far included reports of racially-motivated abuse, assaults and bullying over the last year.</p><p>The Met has now referred 10 cases involving alleged racism to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).</p><p>Eight police officers and one civilian member of staff have been suspended while a further three have been placed on restricted duties. Six of the police officers currently under investigation over alleged racism are from the Olympic borough of Newham.</p><p>The controversy is one of the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/06/metropolitan-police-race-row\" title=\"\">first major challenges</a> to face Hogan-Howe since he became commissioner in September. He is known to have been concerned about the impact on the police's reputation from serious allegations about a force which, 13 years ago, was branded institutionally racist by the Macpherson inquiry which was set up after the death of Stephen Lawrence.</p><p>The latest row began two weeks after the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/30/police-racism-black-man-abuse\" title=\"\">published a recording</a> in which one constable, PC Alex MacFarlane, can be heard racially abusing a suspect. MacFarlane has been suspended.</p><p>Four days later, and after a series of further disclosures, Hogan-Howe <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/03/met-police-commissioner-report-racist-behaviour\" title=\"\">urged his staff</a> to report inappropriate behaviour by colleagues, saying he was \"shocked\" by the revelations and adding: \"I will not stand for any racism or racists.\"</p><p>The decision to refer eight new cases to the IPCC was taken after an internal \"review\" \u2013 and amid growing public concern over the claims of racist language and abuse of black suspects.</p><p>Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the committee, said: \"This is an opportunity to ask the commissioner about the steps he has taken to drive out racism from the Met and to restore confidence in our police service. I welcome the decision taken by the Metropolitan Police to have these incidents investigated thoroughly, and the commissioner's strong words to the force about tackling racism within it. However, these strong words must be backed up with action. It is imperative that there is zero tolerance to racism within the police.\"</p><p>He added: \"Members of the committee have expressed their concerns about the most recent allegations of racism that have surfaced in the last two weeks. We hope the commissioner will be able to update the committee on the action that he has taken.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Metropolitan+police&k=Bernard+Hogan-Howe&k=London&k=Police&k=UK+news&k=Independent+Police+Complaints+Commission\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Met+police+chief+to+face+MPs+over+racism+scandal+Article+1730601&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=Metropolitan+police%2CBernard+Hogan-Howe%2CLondon+%28News%29%2CPolice+and+policing%2CUK+news%2CIPCC+%28Independent+Police+Complaints+Commission%29%2CPolitics%2CRace+issues+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Paul+Lewis&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730601&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/12/met-police-chief-mps-racism-scandal|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|79cb3884e3456e82c0cb8f3b1833402ae5a1dea2 -->",

Yep, after signing exactly 0.4 good players in his time at Liverpool, director of football Damien Comolli has been ushered to the door marked \"Do one\" and been given a big boot in the derriere. Despite wearing clever glasses, Comolli failed to spot that five good games for Newcastle didn't make Andy Carroll worth £35m; a few good crosses for Villa didn't make Stewart Downing Steve Guppy; and being fat didn't make Charlie Adam Matt Le Tissier. Oh, and Jordan Henderson.</p><p></p><p>Jordan Henderson.</p><p></p><p>Still, although some of Comolli's signings were a bit Sebastian Coates, it's harsh to blame the whole thing on him. Because while some his ideas were a bit Doni, nobody made John W Henry write out those transfer cheques. \"Everyone who has come into the club since Damien has been here was of my choice. Once I made the choice who I wanted Damien went away and did a fantastic job of bringing them in,\" said Mr Ken today, checking furiously to see if any referees were responsible for eating the last Twirl in the fridge.</p><p></p><p>Now it should be remembered that Mr Ken has got Liverpool to the FA Cup semi-finals and won Tin Pot this season but the Fiver can't help feeling Comolli's sacking could be a shot across the bows from Liverpool's owners \u2013 bad news for some at Anfield if their poor league form continues. There is hope for Liverpool: if they need to offload any of Comolli's signings at vastly invested prices, Roman Abramovich is rumoured to have his chequebook out this summer.</p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p>\"I will never say we can't win the league if there is still a chance.

        "headline":"Converting audio CDs into digital files",
        "body":"<p><em>You wrote in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/askjack/2011/may/06/ask-jack-scanner-photographs\">another column</a>: 'My preferred strategy for scanning things (or ripping CDs), is to do the job so well that it never has to be done again.' Please could you share your thoughts on the best way to do this?</em><br /><strong>Michael Stevens</strong><br /><br />Converting or \"ripping\" an audio CD into a digital file is a time-consuming process, and there are at least two sensible options. The first is to make a perfect copy using a lossless system such as <a href=\"http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html\">FLAC</a> (Free Lossless Audio Codec). The second is to make a copy that is so good that you will never be able to hear the difference. I chose the second option, and encoded tracks in 320kbps MP3.</p><p>FLAC captures all the information in the recording, but it has two significant disadvantages: it produces large files, and not all portable music players can handle it. (Unfortunately, both Apple and Microsoft have their own lossless formats.) The MP3 codec, by contrast, delivers smaller files that almost every device \u2013 PC, phone, MP3 player, CD player etc \u2013 can play. It's the closest thing we have to a universal music format.</p><p>I could have used a lower bit rate than 320kbps (actually VBR: variable bit rate), and I can't reliably hear the difference between lossless and 196kbps MP3 files. However, using a higher bit rate should mean that when I buy better equipment -\u2013 such as a high-end MP3 player \u2013 it won't expose problems that were masked before. As you may have found, a good quality hi-fi stack and studio monitors can reveal flaws in music files that are inaudible when using a mainstream MP3 player with headphones or earbuds. This applies to CDs as well.</p><p>I could also have used a lower bit rate with the AAC file format, because it is more efficient than MP3. AAC makes a real difference at low bit rates, especially below 128kbps, but it doesn't make any practical difference at 256kbps and higher bit rates. I decided against AAC because it was far less widely supported than MP3, because there are several versions of AAC, and because I noticed most people like me were using MP3. (If a lot of people have the same problem, someone will produce a fix.)</p><p>When I wrote a feature about this, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/apr/12/newmedia.guardianweeklytechnologysection1\">Finding the music format of the future</a>, way back in 2007, I was bullish about AAC. Apple had just decided to offer unprotected 256kbps AAC files alongside its DRM-protected 128kbps AAC files, which I wouldn't use even if they were free. However, AAC has not made the sort of progress I expected, and I haven't regretted choosing MP3.</p><p>So, what's the best way to rip your files? This topic has been debated in considerable depth for at least two decades by people who are much more qualified than I am, so I decided to adopt what many experts considered the best approach. That was to rip CDs using Exact Audio Copy (EAC) software and the open source LAME, following one of the guides at the Hydrogen Audio website: <a href=\"http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=EAC_and_Lame\">EAC and LAME</a>. (The name stands recursively for Lame Aint an MP3 Encoder.)</p><p>I was interested to find that the results sounded better to someone who doesn't have a clue what a file format is, and has zero interest in the topic. I had shown my wife how to rip her own (classical) CDs on a Mac laptop using the iTunes defaults and left her to it: job done. A few days later, she got me to rerip them using my system because she wasn't happy with the sound quality.</p><p>Hydrogen Audio has quite a few <a href=\" http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=\"Category:Guides\"\">Guides</a>, including nine that use EAC. But if you decide to use <a href=\"http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=CDex_and_FLAC\">CDex and FLAC</a>, for example, there's a guide for that.</p><p>Hard drive sizes have grown over the past half dozen years, so we now have 750GB and 1TB drives where we used to have 120GB or 150GB drives. This means the extra size of FLAC files \u2013 which can be roughly half the size of the original WAV files \u2013 is less of an issue. For comparison, a 24-bit FLAC version of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon (1973) takes up 239MB whereas my 320kbps MP3 version takes up 71MB. </p><p>You may find lossless files take up too much space, but it depends how many CDs you want to rip.</p><p>Although not every device will play FLAC, you can use these files to produce MP3, AAC, WMA or other lossy formats for mobile devices. The lossless rip becomes the master copy of the CD, so you never have to rip it again. If you need 320kbps MP3 files for a good quality MP3 player and/or 128kbps versions for a mobile phone, you can make them whenever you like.</p><p>This is not the same as \"transcoding\" between different lossy formats, such as MP3 or WMA and AAC. That leads to a loss in quality, and is always a bad idea.</p><p>I didn't rip things to FLAC, back in the day, and I'm not entirely sure I'd do it now. But if you don't have one or two decades of music files or want to make a fresh start, it's certainly worth considering.</p><p>Also, if we are ever going to move to a system that provides better-than-CD quality, FLAC is by far the most popular format. <a href=\"http://www.linnrecords.com/catalogue.aspx?format=studio\">Linn Records</a> sells 24-bit studio master recordings in FLAC format, and Apple Corps and EMI released a limited edition of The Beatles back catalogue in 24-bit FLAC and 320kbps MP3 on an Apple-shaped USB stick.</p><p>The problem with FLAC files is that Apple iPods won't play them. </p><p>This isn't a practical problem at the moment: they consume so much space, you probably wouldn't want to play FLAC files on a mobile device. However, people who are solidly in the iPod/iPhone/iTunes camp should consider using ALAC, Apple's Lossless Audio Codec, instead. Most iPods with recent firmware can play ALAC files, it's used in Airtunes, and Apple has now made the format open source. Lossless is lossless so ALAC files should sound identical to FLAC files (as long as you have <a href=\"http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=52057\">iTunes' Soundcheck switched off during playback</a>). It's really a matter of convenience.</p><p>Of course, Macs can play FLAC files, and Mac users can convert FLAC (and other) files into other formats using, for example, the open source <a href=\"http://sbooth.org/Max/\">Max</a>. If you are going to transcode audio files for mobile use, it doesn't matter whether you convert them from ALAC or FLAC.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Technology&k=Digital+music+and+audio&k=Digital+rights+management&k=Software&k=Computing\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Converting+audio+CDs+into+digital+files+%7C+Ask+Jack+Article+1730545&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Technology%2CDigital+music+and+audio+%28Technology%29%2CDRM+%28Technology%29%2CSoftware+%28Technology%29%2CComputing+%28Technology%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Jack+Schofield&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730545&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/askjack/2012/apr/12/ask-jack-digital-audio|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|9cc9ad522343e9feefde06a8bf4861ed117daa8d -->",

        "body":"<p>Police and victim support groups have welcomed moves by the Scottish government to make criminals who assault police officers pay to help fund their recuperation.</p><p>The Scottish justice secretary, Kenny MacAskill, announced the initiative, one of the first of its kind in the world, during a visit to a police treatment centre in Auchterarder, Perthshire, which is part funded by contributions from officers' salaries.</p><p>In the last year there were 4,899 convictions for assaults on police officers in the Scottish courts. The new proposal would form part of the forthcoming victims and witnesses bill.</p><p>Ministers are also considering levying a victims' surcharge on criminals, on top of existing compensation orders, to create a fund that would provide help to all victims of crime. MacAskill said: \"The police treatment centres put right the damage done by criminal assaults largely with money raised by donations from the victims. This is the reverse of fair. Instead it is right to expect criminals who assault police to contribute to payment for this treatment. We believe proceeds from penalties should be paid into a fund for officers.</p><p>\"This is a win-win situation which will result in restitution for offenders and recuperation for victims of crime.\"</p><p>At the moment, anyone convicted of assaulting a police officer in the line of duty faces a fine, imprisonment, a community payback order or a compensation order. Under the new plan, another option would be for anyone convicted of such an assault to pay cash to good causes through a restitution order.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Police&k=Scotland&k=Crime&k=UK+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Criminals+who+assault+Scottish+police+to+be+forced+to+pay+for+their+treatment+Article+1730533&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=Police+and+policing%2CScotland+%28News%29%2CCrime+-+UK+%28News%29%2CUK+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Kirsty+Scott&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730533&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/12/criminals-assault-police-pay-treatment|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|6713da600b8b5b7a84ebe54745da19730b37f32e -->",

        "headline":"Black mathematicians: the kind of problems they wish didn't need solving",
        "body":"<p>John Derbyshire, a columnist for the <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/295514/parting-ways-rich-lowry\" title=\"\">National Review</a>, wrote an <a href=\"http://takimag.com/article/the_talk_nonblack_version_john_derbyshire/#axzz1rI2sQ2I7\" title=\"\">essay</a> last week implying that black people were intellectually inferior to white people: \"Only one out of six blacks is smarter than the average white.\" Derbyshire pulled these figures from a region near his large intestine.</p><p>One of Derbyshire's claims, however, is true: that there are no black winners of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal\" title=\"\">Fields medal</a>, the \"Nobel prize of mathematics\". According to Derbyshire, this is \"civilisationally consequential\". Derbyshire implies that the absence of a black winner means that black people are incapable of genius. In reality, black mathematicians face career-retarding racism that white Fields medallists never encounter. Three stories will suffice to make this point.</p><p>The first involves Saunders Mac Lane, one of the most influential algebraists of the last century. He co-authored, with Garrett Birkhoff, a text that enthralled me as a first-year undergraduate. I first encountered <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_%28order%29\" title=\"\">lattice theory</a>, which for a long time I loved more than anything in life, in that book. In 1951, Mac Lane was president of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). Vanderbilt University hosted an MAA conference, and three black mathematicians wished to attend the conference's banquet. They were barred and <a href=\"http://sections.maa.org/southeastern/maase/section/minority.pdf\" title=\"\">Mac Lane refused to take a stand</a>: Vanderbilt University was in racially segregated Tennessee, and he did not want to offend his hosts.</p><p>The second story involves one of the few black mathematicians whom white mathematicians acknowledge as great \u2013 or, I should say, \"black American mathematicians\", since obviously <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid\" title=\"\">Euclid</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Life\" title=\"\">Eratosthenes</a> and other African mathematicians outshone Europe's brightest stars for millennia. His name was David Blackwell. I first met Blackwell in 1995, in the common room of Berkeley's maths department, one of the few times two black people had ever been in the room. Blackwell obtained his PhD in mathematics when he was only 22.</p><p>While he had a fellowship to work at the Institute for Advanced Study, the American home of Einstein and the other-worldly logician <a href=\"http://www.ostina.org/content/view/1155/510/\" title=\"\">Kurt Gödel</a>, nearby <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/education/17blackwell.html\" title=\"\">Princeton University refused to allow Blackwell</a> to attend lectures because he was black. Although he later became the first black member of the National Academy of Sciences (with a colleague saying, \"he would come into a field that had been well studied and find something really new that was remarkable\"), the University of California at Berkeley's maths department would not hire Blackwell on account of his race (a European later asked Blackwell to join the statistics department).</p><p>My third story is not that in 2002, after I wrote an article about Confederate remembrance, supporters of the Ku Klux Klan <a href=\"http://www.wienerzeitung.at/themen_channel/wz_reflexionen/zeitgenossen/34836_Jonathan-Farley.html\" title=\"\">sent me death threats</a>, forcing me to leave my home and my permanent job at Vanderbilt University. Others, such as Barrett Brown <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/dec/26/american-civil-war-usa\" title=\"\">in the Guardian</a> and  <a href=\"http://latticetheory.net/media/pdf/Hot_Fat_Clouded_Excerpt.pdf\" title=\"\">in his book Hot, Fat, and Clouded</a>, have recounted how little support I got from the university authorities during this ordeal.</p><p>The last tale is not either that, when I was a professor there, police at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology detained me on suspicion of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/nov/07/dnaofthekkk\" title=\"\">being a bank robber</a>.</p><p>No, my final story is that, in 2009, I was an invited speaker at the Counterterrorism Research Lab (CRL), along with US president Barack Obama's soon-to-be <a href=\"http://static.sdu.dk/mediafiles/Files/Om_SDU/Fakulteterne/Teknik/Diverse/CTRWorkshop.pdf\" title=\"\">cybersecurity tsar</a>, Howard Schmidt. At one point, a fellow American brought up the civil war, and said \u2013 angrily \u2013 that the pro-black-slavery Confederacy had the right to secede. I objected as politely as I could. The man exploded, firing off a chain of expletives in front of the 80-person audience. I was blamed for his outburst, and a job offer that had been previously discussed disappeared (it had happened before, when prospective employers withdrew offers after hearing about the Klan attacks). Along the same lines, a senior officer of the <a href=\"http://latticetheory.net/media/pdf/Personal_Reflections_on_Beauty_and_Terror_Page_388.pdf\" title=\"\">National Academies</a> ceased communication with me when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2001/nov/17/highereducation.uk\" title=\"\">he saw my essay</a> in the Guardian about racism.</p><p>Before I was 30, I had solved decades-old problems posed by the world-renowned <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2004/aandh-0519.html\" title=\"\">Richard Stanley</a> at MIT. At 32, the Klan attack sidetracked me. I probably never would have won, but one must be under 40 to win a Fields, and I have not had time to focus on Fields medal-worthy pursuits. Other black people fared likewise.</p><p>Losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in income pales besides <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57401619-504083/author-of-stand-your-ground-law-george-zimmerman-should-probably-be-arrested-for-killing-trayvon-martin/\" title=\"\">being shot for Skittles</a>, so I do not complain. Instead, I let Harvard's Stephen Jay Gould reply to Derbyshire: \"Few tragedies can be more extensive than the stunting of life, few injustices deeper than the denial of an opportunity to strive or even to hope, by a limit imposed from without, but falsely identified as lying within.\" What gives me hope is that race relations are not what they were in 2002. The National Review fired Derbyshire. White people helped my career \u2013 specifically Birkhoff's student George Markowsky and Austria's Günter Pilz \u2013 but Blackwell refused to speak with me for even one minute: perhaps race is asymptotically approaching irrelevance.</p><p>At last.</p><p>\u2022 Professor Jonathan David Farley won the Harvard Foundation's Scientist of the Year medal in 2004</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Race+issues&k=Mathematics&k=World+news&k=United+States&k=Mathematics&k=Science\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Black+mathematicians%3A+the+kind+of+problems+they+wish+didn%27t+need+solving+%7C+Jonathan+Farley+Article+1729697&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=148491&c4=Race+issues+%28News%29%2CMathematics+%28Education+subject%29%2CWorld+news%2CUS+news%2CMathematics+%28science%29%2CScience%2CEducation&c3=Guardian+Weekly&c6=Jonathan+Farley&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1729697&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/12/black-mathematicians-john-derbyshire-fields-medal|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|7e0f7d39a97f16f9402ca932cb87ec306331f01f -->",

        "trailText":"<p>Botnet caused by infections most recently through Java exploit may have infected up to 1% of installed base \u2013 but are the risks for Mac owners really growing? By <strong>Charles Arthur</strong></p>",
        "headline":"Apple readies Flashback malware removal tool: but how big is the risk?",
        "body":"<p>Apple says it will develop a tool to remove the Flashback malware reckoned to have infected more than 600,000 Macintosh computers worldwide, most recently via a flaw in Oracle's Java software, following the worst attacks against the platform in the past decade.</p><p>But in a <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5244\">brief document posted on Wednesday</a>, the company did not offer any advice on how users could find out whether their machine was infected, nor \u2013 aside from updating their software \u2013 how they could protect themselves against infection.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Apple has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/apr/13/apple-flashback-java-malware-fix\">released the removal tool, for systems running Mac OSX 10.6 and 10.7.</a> Users of systems running earlier versions of Mac OS X are advised to disable Java.</p><p>(<strong>The security company <a href=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002336.html\">F-Secure has instructions so that Mac users can discover whether they are infected</a>. <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/04/05/mac-flashback-trojan-check/\">Mashable also offers links to a pair of scripts</a> that will check Safari \u2013 though not other browsers \u2013 for infection.</strong>)</p><p>The first variants of Flashback appeared last September, masquerading as updates to Adobe's Flash player software. More recent variants exploited other flaws \u2013 notably in Java.</p><p>Once installed, the malware monitors network traffic to steal passwords and login details for various sites and systems, attempts to install itself as a root program able to access all users' files, and may also download other software from control servers silently. It could also organise infected machines into a botnet able to attack websites or, potentially, host fake websites and other unwanted content.</p><p>The latest version using the Java exploit meant users could be infected without taking any action via their browser if Java was enabled simply by navigating to an infected site. </p><p>A number of websites require Java to provide functionality. Although Java is not included in Mac OS X 10.7, aka Lion, which was released last year, anyone who had upgraded their system from an earlier version of the OS would have it, as would anyone who downloaded it to run programs such as Adobe's Creative Suite.</p><p>Crucially, Apple maintains its own version of Java, and had left the flaw unpatched for weeks: Oracle released a fix on 17 February, which was distributed to Windows users. </p><p>Brian Krebs, a security expert, <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/04/urgent-fix-for-zero-day-mac-java-flaw/\">comments</a> that Apple's lackadaisical (and often <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/apple-took-3-years-to-fix-finfisher-trojan-hole/\">plain puzzling</a>) response to patching dangerous security holes perpetuates the harmful myth that Mac users don't need to be concerned about malware attacks.</p><p>Krebs says: \"If you don't need Java, remove it from your system, whether you are a Mac or Windows user.\"</p><p>The extent of the outbreak makes the Flashback infection, which was first detected at the end of March by the Russian security firm Dr Web, by far the largest ever to hit the Mac OSX platform. In relative terms, it is at least equivalent to the <a href=\"http://mtc.sri.com/Conficker/\">Conficker outbreak on Windows</a>, which affected millions of PCs \u2013 though only affecting less than 1% of the total installed base. </p><p>In the second half of 2011, Apple Macintosh sales passed 5% of the total PC market for the first time in more than a decade; the <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1981717\">latest figures from Gartner</a> say that in the US, it achieved 10% of personal computer sales in the first quarter of the year. That may have led malware writers to target the platform with renewed vigour.</p><p>Neither Flasback's authors nor their location has become clear. In May 2011, Russian hackers targeted <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/what-a-mac-malware-attack-looks-like/3269?tag=content;siu-containerr\">Mac OS X, which was hit by a wave of infections</a> driven by a Trojan program called MacDefender \u2013 often spread via infected images in Google's image search. But the combination of a software update from Apple, and a <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/08/raid-reveals-evidence-of-chronopay-ties-to-macdefender-scareware.ars\">raid by Russian police</a> put paid to the short-lived attack.</p><p>Although a number of commentators forecast at the time of MacDefender that it was the beginning of a fresh wave of attacks against the Mac OS X platform, it didn't materalise. At the same time, companies including Microsoft have made renewed efforts to close down botnets and capture those behind aggressive malware.</p><p>John Welch, who administers several hundred Macs for the organisation where he works, discovered that a number of the machines were infected by forms of Flashback, although in many cases the installation failed; that in turn locked out users who tried to log onto the machines, because certain files that Flashback told the system to load were not present. (The organisation uses Sophos antivirus on its machines.</p><p>\"It seems that the programmers behind it simply found a better infection vector, and used it,\" Welch told the Guardian. \"I'm not *that* impressed with it, I've seen too many half-done attempts to infect a machine where the silly thing couldn't even install correctly, so I'm not sure it's really all that clever.\"</p><p>He thinks that the principal threat will continue to be from infected documents rather than the core OS \u2013 though, he says: \"... not because Mac OS X or UNIX are magically invulnerable. (There's a lot of magical thinking on this subject.) It's more because due to some well-intentioned, but poor decisions made by Microsoft decades ago, the path to infect Windows was an eight-lane highway vs the muddy goat trail that was Unix. However, if you move off the OS proper, it gets more common.\"</p><p>Most high-profile attacks in the past few years have come from infected files which use weaknesses in associated software: Adobe's PDF and Flash Player have become increasingly common targets on both the Windows and Mac platforms, while Microsoft's Office suite \u2013 of Word, Excel and Powerpoint \u2013 are also frequently targeted by hackers seeking to subvert systems. </p><p>\"If it runs code, it can be compromised and run malware,\" Welch notes. \"It's just a matter of how much brainpower and skill someone wants to put behind it. Given the kind of money malware is now generating, there is a lot of both involved.\"</p><p>But he does think Apple has been too slow to react. \"This is a problem for Apple, and one I hope goes away with [Steve] Jobs not running the company. He had some issues with communication. I think Apple needs to speed up its reaction to verified threats, and they need to stop treating everything like it's [as secret as] the next iPhone. Yes, some things do need a great deal of security, but patching a *Java security hole* is not one of them. I know it's easy to get into that 'MUST NEVER SAY ANYTHING UNTIL IT'S DONE' mentality, but this has burned Apple in the past. They've improved somewhat, but have a ways to go.\"</p><p>With Apple having made both Flash and Java optional installations on existing desktop systems, the \"attack surface\" for malware authors has lessened. Welch points out: \"Java is a useful tool that fixes certain problems better than other tools. It's no more necessary than any other language or runtime. </p><p>\"A huge percentage of malware attacks happen via email and websites, yet no one asks 'should we really be using email and browsing the web?' [The open source database] MySQL and [web scripting language] PHP are commonly attacked, and successfully; no one questions those tools, even though they are a common infection vector.</p><p>If Java is the best, or even an equally good tool for the job, I think one is silly to ignore it because 'it's an infection vector'. So is PDF. I don't see people advocating the end of PDF. Bagging on Java in this case is silly. I do like that Apple doesn't install it by default, which I think is a good idea. The need for it is not *common* over the entire population of computer users, so making it an optional install is not a bad idea at all.\"</p><p>Yet even with the latest infection, amounting to 1% of the estimated installed base of Macs, there aren't so far signs of a deluge of attacks against Macs. Between MacDefender in May of 2011, and Flashback between September and the present day, the amount of Mac-targeting malware remains remarkably low; while Graham Cluley of Sophos points out in \"<a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/10/03/mac-malware-history/\">a short history of Mac malware</a>\", the amount targeting the platform has trebled in the past three years \u2013 but that still only amounts to a couple of new attacks per year. And one piece of software identified as \"malware\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2010/jun/02/mac-spyware-removed-premieropinion\">from PremierOpinion</a>, is arguably no such thing, but a user-sanctioned tracking system for web use. </p><p>Sophos does offer <a href=\"http://www.sophos.com/freemacav\">free antivirus software for Mac users</a> \u2013 though it's not available through the App Store (because Apple limits what can be sold through it; apparently antivirus software isn't allowed.) Graham Lee, formerly of Sophos, also points out that antivirus apps <strong>sold through the App Store</strong> can't do real-time scanning, because they aren't allowed to install kernel extensions \u2013 which means that new infections can't be caught as they happen, but only retrospectively. (<strong>Note:</strong> apps not installed via the App Store can install kernel extensions, and so can do real-time scanning - as Sophos AV does. Apologies for not clarifying this initially.)</p><p>The question now is whether the attacks will get worse \u2013 or if malware authors have other targets they can more profitably focus on. Whereas even five years ago the options for malware authors were simple \u2013 write something to attack Windows machines, or Macs; the potential rewards were over 19 times greater for the former \u2013 now there are almost as many smartphones (where Android apps have become an attractive source of revenue for some, using \"Trojan diallers\" which silently dial expensive numbers or transmit sender-pays text messages) and, increasingly, websites which have credit card details, or phishing sites that can capture login details for PayPal or for webmail accounts \u2013 where the latter can then be used to send out <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2011/aug/05/beware-hackers-take-over-gmail-account\">fake frantic messages claiming you've been mugged</a>, and asking for untraceable wire payments.</p><p>In short, Apple may actually have been fortunate enough to survive the riskiest time \u2013 when the desktop and laptop computer were the principal form for computing \u2013 as malware has moved to a cross-platform format in which phones, websites, databases and simple social engineering have become equally good methods for criminals to get access to personal and financial details. It doesn't though mean that the danger has passed. But while 600,000 machines infected is certainly a lot, it pales in comparison to the millions of credit cards compromised by the attack on Sony's PlayStation Network, or the <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/03/mastercard-visa-warn-of-processor-breach/\">more recent hack of a US payments processor</a>. </p><p>In short: have antivirus, but the bigger threats are probably outside your computer.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Apple&k=Malware&k=Data+and+computer+security&k=Technology&k=Computing&k=Internet\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Apple+readies+Flashback+malware+removal+tool%3A+but+how+big+is+the+risk%3F+Article+1730384&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Apple+%28Technology%29%2CMalware%2CData+and+computer+security+%28safeguarding+computers+and+data+from+criminals%29%2CTechnology%2CComputing+%28Technology%29%2CInternet%2CSoftware+%28Technology%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Charles+Arthur&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730384&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/2012/apr/12/apple-flashback-malware-tool-risks|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|10aa17bc6d931b2d01e23b348fce3e2f599eca58 -->",

        "headline":"Cycle stunt team launches competition to find new female member",
        "body":"<p>Scotland's cycle stunt team, <a href=\"http://www.mb7.com/theclan/\" title=\"\">The Clan</a>, have launched a competition to find a new member to join them on this summer's tour of events. The winning rider must be skilled, committed, fearless and, most importantly of all, female.</p><p></p><p>It's the second year in a row that The Clan, the only UK stunt cycling team to feature female riders, has run a competition to find a new female member. Last year, they had six entrants. This year, with more than a week still to go before the deadline, they already have 10 in the running for the £5,000 prize; a sign, say the organisers, of a growing interest in the sport, and cycling in general, among girls and women.</p><p></p><p>Since they formed in 2008 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/bike-blog/2011/feb/20/danny-macaskill-bike-tricks\" title=\"\">Danny MacAskill</a> was a founder member \u2013 The Clan have insisted on having female members for the majority of their shows, relying initially on recommendations from friends and acquaintances of the six-strong team.</p><p></p><p>The Clan manager, Iain Withers, says:</p><p><blockquote>\"It's important to have diversity in our team and especially to ensure a female rider is present to show all the girls out there riding is not just for boys. \"It comes from the vibe of our show, trying to convince people that cycling is cool and fun and exciting for everyone. We have employed female riders since year one.  We were going round schools for Cycling Scotland and there was a lot of research that made it quite clear that if girls are going to get into cycling they need female role models to look up to.  That's what started it off.<br /><br />\"We were a little bit daunted to go and find a female rider because it's such a male dominated area. We didn't know if there was anyone out there who would be willing and capable but we have been really lucky. There have been six girls who have now done our shows and really the lesson has been that the talent is out there but it is just hidden away This year we have already got 10 really strong entries, quite a diverse range of talent from BMX to mountain biking. It's very promising.\"<br /></blockquote></p><p></p><p>The group runs shows at national sports events and community galas across Scotland in May and June. This year, for the first time, they'll be holding a women's weekend for all competition entrants in early May so that they can train and practice together on custom-built ramps and in a foam pit designed to allow riders to crash without hurting themselves.</p><p></p><p>Age, says Withers, should be no barrier.</p><p></p><p>\"Last year, we had a very strong entry from a mountain biker who was 15 at the time. She can't do it this year because she has exams but she's a really talented rider. Our first rider, Lynne Aitchison, who has since moved to Canada, is in her mid-30s. You can be any age. If we get some granny flying through the air that would be good stuff.\"</p><p></p><p>Speaking from Whistler in British Columbia, Aitchison says The Clan's insistence on featuring female riders is crucial for promoting the sport as widely as possible.</p><p></p><p>\"Having a female member of The Clan has been a really good thing as far as getting the message across to young girls that it's not just about boys,\" she says. \"When we went round schools the girls thought I was the bee's knees because I was a girl and I was doing all the tricks as well.\"</p><p></p><p>Aitchison only got into cycling in her late 20s and was in her 30s when she joined The Clan.</p><p></p><p>\"I did martial arts for a long time but I got a bit sick of doing sports inside. I had a bunch of male friends who mountain biked and I thought I'd try it out and I was hooked. I found I kind of excelled at jumping. I did my first back flip when I was 31.</p><p></p><p>\"It was a little intimidating for me at first to ride with a bunch of pretty highly skilled guys. I was 30 years old and I didn't get into biking until my late 20s. The guys in The Clan are really down to earth, really nice guys. They're all about riding rather than the kudos of being a bit of a stunt cyclist.\"</p><p></p><p>Aitchison has also set up <a href=\"http://www.airmaiden.com/\" title=\"\">Air Maiden</a> the annual women-only bike skills event at Glentress in the Tweed Valley.

        "headline":"Mitt Romney enjoys some security as vice-presidential contenders shy away",
        "body":"<p>Florida senator Marco Rubio and Virginia governor Bob McDonnell have participated in the long-established ritual of ruling themselves out as running-mates for Mitt Romney, who on Wednesday enjoyed his first full day as undisputed Republican presidential candidate. </p><p>Rubio and McDonnell join a growing queue of Republicans who insist they do not want to be the Republican vice-presidential candidate \u2013 but they have to say that, concerned they would end up looking foolish if they express an interest and Romney fails to pick them.</p><p>McDonnell, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505267_162-57412286/mcdonnell-santorum-should-back-romney/\">interviewed on CBS on Wednesday</a>, said he was happy being governor of Virginia. \"I got the job held by Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry \u2013 governor of Virginia. Doesn't get any better than that,\" McDonnell said.</p><p>With Rick Santorum's departure from the race on Tuesday, speculation began in earnest over the last big vacancy of the 2012 campaign to be filled, even though Romney is unlikely to announce his choice for months. Learning from the mistakes of John McCain's team in 2008, Romney's team will ensure their choice, unlike Sarah Palin, will be thoroughly vetted.</p><p>Santorum has expressed interest in the post but his harsh criticism of Romney would be exploited by Democrats, repeatedly replayed in ads.\"I think Santorum probably is not going to be in line for the VP spot because it's just been too nasty and contentious,\" Bradley Blakeman, a politics professor at Georgetown University, <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Santorum-Blakeman-campaign-withdrawal/2012/04/10/id/435439\">told Newsmax</a>. \"I think that he certainly can serve in a Romney administration if they find the right place for him where he can be helpful.\"</p><p>Rubio is repeatedly cited as among the frontrunners because he is a Latino, a demographic group that Romney and other Republicans have alienated, and because he represents Florida, a swing state that could determine the outcome of the White House race. \"I'm not going to be the vice-president,\" Rubio said, a line he has been repeating since last summer.  </p><p>But if offered the post, it would be hard to resist a platform from which to launch a bid of his own for the presidency in 2016 or 2020.</p><p>Susana Martinez, the governor of New Mexico, is another prospective vice-presidential candidate, with the advantage of not only being from a Latino background but a woman, a demographic group with which Romney struggles compared with Obama. Martinez, like Rubio, has ruled out the job. \"It's humbling but I'm not interested,\" she told the Associated Press. </p><p>Much of the speculation focuses on issues such as gender, geography or ethnic background, working on the assumption that these will help bring in voters on the margin. But recent political history shows that presidential candidates have tended to buck this received wisdom, spectacularly so in the case of McCain in picking a running-mate from Alaska, which has almost no impact on the presidential race, and a woman who alienated women in droves.</p><p>Conservative commentator George Will, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/romney-needs-a-heavy-hitter-as-his-vice-president/2012/04/06/gIQAB0sVzS_story.html\">writing in the Washington Post</a>, noted that since the second world war, 10 presidential candidates have failed to win the home state of their vice-presidential running mates. He argued instead in favour of two candidates experienced in budgetary issues and adminstration, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal or Paul Ryan, chairman of the House budget committee.</p><p>\"So Romney's running-mate should have intellectual firepower, born of immersion in policy complexities, sufficient to refute Obama's meretricious claims and derelictions of duty. Here are two excellent choices,\" Will writes.<br />Both Jindal and Ryan have ruled out being Romney's running-mate, as have New Jersey governor Chris Christie, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, and Ohio senator Rob Portman.</p><p>One of the few Republicans to publicly express an interest in the job is Herman Cain. Part of the reason may be that he, unlike others, have opted to say he would consider it is because he is a long shot, having been forced out of the Republican presidential race late last year amid allegations of sexual harassment.</p><p>Asked by Fox how he would react if approached by Romney's campaign team about the job, he said: \"I would say 'Let's talk'. It's not a slam-dunk.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=US+elections+2012&k=Mitt+Romney&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&k=United+States&k=US+politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mitt+Romney+enjoys+some+security+as+vice-presidential+contenders+shy+away+Article+1730154&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=US+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CMitt+Romney+%28News%29%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CUS+news%2CUS+politics&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-11&c8=1730154&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/11/mitt-romney-vice-presidential-prospects|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|5a05fff1af7b264d42aae275a0816a3ef2c4de7d -->",

        "headline":"Jack Tramiel obituary",
        "body":"<p>Jack Tramiel, who has died aged 83, will be remembered as the father of the Commodore 64, which dominated the home computer market of the 1980s. It shipped more than 20m units \u2013 an astonishing number at the time \u2013 and was often described as&nbsp;the bestselling computer of&nbsp;all time.</p><p>Unlike most of his competitors, Tramiel (pronounced Tra-mell) was not a technology geek. He was a jovial, cigar-smoking, balding and somewhat portly Jewish businessman known for hard bargaining and for the slogan: \"Business is war.\" He drove down costs, cut prices and marketed the hell out of whatever he was selling. He said he targeted \"the masses, not the&nbsp;classes\".</p><p>No one would have predicted Tramiel becoming, somewhat briefly, America's most successful computer tycoon. An&nbsp;only child, he was born, according to&nbsp;differing accounts, as Idek Tramielski or Jacek Trzmiel, in Lodz, Poland, which&nbsp;was occupied by the Nazis in&nbsp;1939. In 1944, Tramiel's family was sent from the city's Jewish ghetto to Auschwitz. He was finally liberated from the Ahlem labour camp, near Hanover, by&nbsp;the US army in April 1945. His father did not survive.</p><p>The 18-year-old Tramiel married Helen Goldgrub, a Bergen-Belsen survivor, in 1947, then emigrated to&nbsp;the US. In 1948 he joined the&nbsp;US army, where he learned how to repair office equipment. On leaving in 1952, he used a&nbsp;$25,000 GI loan to set up a repair shop, Commodore Portable Typewriter, in the Bronx, New York. In 1955 he founded Commodore Business Machines, in Toronto, to import and sell typewriters, moving to California in&nbsp;1968.</p><p>Tramiel's lucky break came in the person of Chuck Peddle, lead designer at MOS Technology. Commodore had bought this small American chip manufacturer to supply parts for its pocket calculators. Peddle told him that computers were the future, and that MOS had developed the cheap 6502 microprocessor, which appeared later in the Apple II, Acorn BBC and other home computers. He let Peddle design the Commodore PET (personal electronic transactor) around the 6502, and in 1977 CBM entered the computer market.</p><p>The PET was followed by the limited but very cheap Vic-20, and in 1982 by the Commodore 64. This was marketed for its huge 64K of memory, though only 38K was free to the built-in Basic. The C64 used custom MOS Technology sound and graphics, so no rival was able to get anywhere near its $595 price. Tramiel duly started a price war, reducing it in stages to $199.</p><p>Commodore did $1bn worth of&nbsp;business in 1983, then Tramiel suddenly resigned after a dispute with the company chairman, the Canadian financier (and major shareholder) Irving Gould. He was not away for long. A few months later, he bought the ailing Atari consumer games business from Warner Brothers, and went head-to-head against Commodore in the old 8-bit and new 16-bit markets. However, he soon started to take a back seat, and his three sons took over the bulk of the work.</p><p>The main US computer companies were moving from the 6502 and its ilk to the 16/32-bit Motorola 68000 processor: Apple with the Macintosh, Commodore with the Amiga, and Tramiel's Atari with the 520ST, known as the Jackintosh. It delivered most of the capabilities of the Mac for a fraction of the price. However, IBM-compatible PCs were taking over the market, and Microsoft Windows dominated the 1990s. Commodore declared bankruptcy in 1994, with only Commodore UK surviving into 1995.</p><p>Atari tried to innovate with the Lynx colour handheld games console, the 64-bit Jaguar and the Atari Portfolio, the first PC-compatible palmtop. None took off. Tramiel sold up in 1996 and retired to Monte Sereno, California, with a&nbsp;palatial house and two Rolls-Royces.</p><p>Outside computing, Tramiel gave talks about the Holocaust at schools and universities, and he was a founding philanthropic supporter of the <a href=\"http://www.ushmm.org/\" title=\"\">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</a> in&nbsp;Washington, DC. He never forgot.</p><p>Tramiel is survived by Helen, their three sons, Sam, Leonard and Garry, and&nbsp;five grandchildren.</p><p>\u2022 Jack Tramiel, businessman, born 13 December 1928; died 8 April 2012</p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBvbsPNBIyk\" title=\"\">Commodore 64 \u2013 25th Anniversary Celebration</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9C8xbbaRRA\" title=\"\">Jack Tramiel, Commodore Computers founder, interviewed</a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Computing&k=Technology&k=United+States&k=World+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Jack+Tramiel+obituary+Article+1730107&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Computing+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Jack+Schofield&c7=12-Apr-11&c8=1730107&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/2012/apr/11/jack-tramiel|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|878f12de0ae3adf60140f0ab897af67f1326dbb5 -->",

        "body":"<p>The US government has accused Apple and five book publishers of colluding to fix the prices of ebooks.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/88883288/e-Books-04112012\">A lawsuit filed in New York on Wednesday</a> said Apple had conspired with publishers in response to Amazon's success in selling ebooks for just under $10. </p><p>It said the alleged price-fixing came as Apple prepared to launched the iPad and was guaranteed a 30% commission on each ebook sold.</p><p>The publishers listed in the lawsuit include Hachette SA, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin and Simon &amp; Schuster. </p><p>Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon &amp; Schuster settled their suits on Wednesday. Bloomberg News reported that Apple and Macmillan had refused to engage in settlement talks with the US department of justice, and will argue that pricing agreements between Apple and publishers improved competition in a field that had been hitherto dominated by Amazon.</p><p>Apple has not yet made a statement in reaction to the legal action.</p><p>Announcing the lawsuit at a press conference in Washington on Wednesday, US attorney-general Eric Holder described shadowy back-room meetings, where Apple would each quarter get together with publishers to discuss \"confidential competitive matters\" and set the prices of their ebooks.</p><p>Holder said: \"Beginning in the summer of 2009, we allege that executives at the highest levels of the companies included in today's lawsuit \u2013 concerned that ebook sellers had reduced prices \u2013 worked together to eliminate competition among stores selling ebooks, ultimately increasing prices for consumers. As a result of this alleged conspiracy, we believe that consumers paid millions of dollars more for some of the most popular titles.\"</p><p>\"Our investigation even revealed that one CEO allegedly went so far as to encourage an ebook retailer to punish another publisher for not engaging in these illegal practices.\"</p><p>Holder also defined the terms of the settlement with Hachette, HarperCollins and Simon &amp; Schuster, which would require the publishers \"to grant retailers \u2013 such as Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble \u2013 the freedom to reduce the prices of their ebook titles.\"</p><p>The complaint, which was filed by the antitrust division of the US department of justice, read: \"Apple facilitated the publisher defendants' collective effort to end retail price competition by coordinating their transition to an agency model across all retailers.\"</p><p>With Apple's iBookstore, ebook authors and sellers must hand over a 30% cut of each sale. Under this system, known as the \"agency model\", publishers, rather than vendors, set the prices, giving Apple and the publishers an incentive to charge more.</p><p>The lawsuit reads: \"As a result of discussions with the publisher defendants, Apple learned that the publisher defendants shared a common objective with Apple to limit ebook retail price competition, and that the publisher defendants also desired to have popular ebook retail prices stabilise at levels significantly higher than $9.99. </p><p>\"Together, Apple and the publisher defendants reached an agreement whereby retail price competition would cease (which all the conspirators desired), retail ebook prices would increase significantly (which the publisher defendants desired), and Apple would be guaranteed a 30% 'commission' on each ebook it sold (which Apple desired).\"</p><p>Amazon's pricing model, by contrast, gives ebook authors and sellers greater flexibility to price what they like for their work.</p><p>John Sarget, the chief executive officer of MacMillan, said in a letter to authors, illustrators and agents that the company has not settled because it is \"hard to settle a lawsuit when you know you have done no wrong.\"</p><p>He said: \"Macmillan did not act illegally. Macmillan did not collude.\"</p><p>Sargent said the filing of the lawsuit came after discussions with the department ofj ustice that lasted months. \"But the terms the DOJ demanded were too onerous. After careful consideration, we came to the conclusion that the terms could have allowed Amazon to recover the monopoly position it had been building before our switch to the agency model,\" he said. </p><p>\"We also felt the settlement the DOJ wanted to impose would have a very negative and long term impact on those who sell books for a living, from the largest chain stores to the smallest independents.\"</p><p>John Makinson, chairman and CEO of Penguin, wrote in a statement: \"A responsible company does not choose a path of litigation with US government agencies without carefully weighing the implications of that course of action.\"</p><p>Penguin opted not to settle, according to Makinson, for two reasons: \"The first is that we have done nothing wrong. The decisions that we took, many them of them costly and difficult, were taken by Penguin alone.\"</p><p>The second reason, he said, is that \"the agency model is the one that offers consumers the prospect of an open and competitive market for ebooks.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Apple&k=E-readers&k=Publishing&k=United+States&k=Amazon.com&k=Technology\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Apple+accused+by+US+of+colluding+with+publishers+to+fix+price+of+ebooks+Article+1730006&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Apple+%28Technology%29%2CE-readers%2CPublishing+%28Books%29%2CUS+news%2CAmazon.com+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology%2CBusiness%2CBooks%2CWorld+news%2CDigital+media%2CNew+York+%28News%29%2CMedia%2CCulture&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Brian+Braiker&c7=12-Apr-11&c8=1730006&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/2012/apr/11/apple-accused-fixing-prices-ebooks|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|2df9bcefce501bf40edcd05ee9c53bc65db836e7 -->",

        "headline":"Prometheus preview footage: five things we learned",
        "body":"<p>It's T-50 until the release of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145506/prometheus\" title=\"\">Prometheus</a> and on Tuesday the great and the good (OK, film hacks from around Europe) were invited to London's Leicester Square to watch a teensy bit more footage from the movie.</p><p>The crowd were shown approximately five minutes of new material, including what may be the entirety of the opening scene in which archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her lover and colleague Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) uncover a pictogram that Shaw sees as confirmation that aliens visited Earth in pre-history and invited humans back to theirs. Next we were whisked straight off into space and the exploratory vehicle Prometheus. We are introduced to the crew, from push-up loving suit Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) to disgruntled staffer Fifield (Sean Harris). There's an on-ship briefing, a bit of truculent banter and the judicious use of technology which, it's fair to say, is far more sophisticated than that in the Nostromo, despite it taking to the skies decades later (in Alien time). From there the descent begins to planet LV223 and, one suspects, the trouble starts.</p><p>Back on Earth, we got the chance to pop a few questions in the direction of cast members Theron, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/michael-fassbender\" title=\"\">Michael Fassbender</a>  (who plays the ship's android, David) and Rapace. Oh, and Mother himself, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/ridley-scott\" title=\"\">Ridley Scott</a>. With the film so highly anticipated and its relation to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/75860/alien\" title=\"\">Alien</a> series of movies <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2011/dec/23/prometheus-trailer-alien-ridley-scott\" title=\"\">still debated</a>, what did we learn from this little event?</p><p><strong>1)</strong> It's all about the \"space jockey\". The colloquial name for the creature uncovered by the crew of the Nostromo in the original Alien, the space jockey (James Cameron calls it \"the big dental patient\") is a carcass, its chest exploded in bits, probably by a xenomorph. In the Q+A, Scott said the \"who is the space jockey?\" question will be answered and that the film is \"the story of a pilot\".</p><p><strong>2)</strong> Elizabeth Shaw is the new Ripley. This may not surprise everyone \u2013 although it did one journalist, who asked Theron what it was like to follow in the footsteps of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/sigourney-weaver\" title=\"\">Sigourney Weaver</a> only to be told to redirect her question to Rapace instead. Shaw is the wide-eyed archaeologist who, in the UK trailer, discovers a crucial cave painting that leads to a trip into the stars. By the end of the movie, we're reliably informed, Shaw is transformed into a hardened, remorseless soldier. Whether that's a hardened, remorseless soldier with a weakness for ginger cats, remains to be seen.</p><p> <strong>3)</strong> Watch out for the Weyland Corporation. That's the company that funds Shaw's trip across the universe, and its CEO and founder is a nonagenarian called Peter (Guy Pearce in, it's fair to say, excessive prosthetics). Of course, anyone with even a passing association with the Alien movies will know that suits are not to be trusted. The footage showed a hologram of an apparently now deceased Weyland (that can happen during a transgalactic journey) publicly humiliating his charge, Vickers. This suggests they're still not to be touched with an electrified bargepole.</p><p><strong>4)</strong> There will be other Alien echoes. More than just a few, perhaps. While Scott says the links between Prometheus and the original film will only become clear \"in the final seven minutes\", it seems as though there will be a deliberate pairing of characters and events throughout. So for Shaw read Ripley, for Idris Elba's Janek read Tom Skerrit's Dallas (the scruffy but debonair captain) and there seems to be an expanded cast of disgruntled below-stairs workers too. Most intriguingly though, Scott hinted at there being an equivalent to the defining chestburst scene. When asked about the original, Scott said there will be a refiguring of some sorts in Prometheus; \"There will be an equivalent, but it will be private to Shaw,\" he said. The lucky girl.</p><p><strong>5)</strong> Fassbender might just steal the show. Everyone's favourite half-German plays David, the sole android on ship. Again, we know that in Alien Iain Holm's Ash sold the entire crew out. Will David do the same? That audience suspicion will seemingly be played on as, going by the footage, Fassbender plays David as an airy, affable butler figure, shuffling around the ship with the awkward grace of an arthritic ballet dancer. The character looks almost lovable, which would make for an even better doublecross. In London, Fassbender cited an intriguing mixture of influences for his role, ranging from the obvious, Blade Runner, to the unlikely, Dirk Bogarde's The Servant and Lawrence of Arabia, to the downright odd, in the shape of former Olympic diver Greg Louganis.</p><p>\u2022 This article was amended on Wednesday 11 April 2012. We originally said that Prometheus lands on planet LFE222, in fact the ship lands on LV223. This has been corrected. </p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/film&k=Science+fiction+and+fantasy&k=Film&k=Culture\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/film/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/film/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Prometheus+preview+footage%3A+five+things+we+learned+Article+1729659&ch=Film&c2=148491&c4=Science+fiction+and+fantasy+%28Film+genre%29%2CFilm%2CCulture&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Paul+MacInnes&c7=12-Apr-11&c8=1729659&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: film/filmblog/2012/apr/11/prometheus-preview-five-things-learned|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|cf5fb20be0c860263b4cb7ec8a7442a035df6abb -->",

The gang used specialist tools to lever out bricks and make a 3ft by 2ft hole to squeeze through, before seizing an 18th-century jade bowl and a <a href=\"http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_21879.htm\" title=\"\">Dehua porcelain</a> sculpture, almost certainly to order. Overseas buyers with very deep pockets, including some in China where the artworks were originally created, have created a thriving market for such items.</p><p>The pieces were taken from the ground-floor Malcolm MacDonald gallery at 10.40pm last Thursday.</p><p>The university has been the victim of high-profile theft before, when its Shakespeare first folio was stolen in 1998 and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jul/09/raymond-scott-stolen-shakespeare-first-folio\" title=\"\">later criminally obtained by local antiques dealer and eccentric Raymond Scott</a>.</p><p>The book was recovered, slightly damaged, and Scott was jailed. He was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/mar/14/shakespeare-folio-dealer-dead-scott\" title=\"\">found dead in prison</a> earlier this year.</p><p>Police have arrested five people from the West Midlands for questioning about the theft of the Chinese pieces but have not yet recovered either of the stolen artefacts. Both date from the 18th-century period of the Qing dynasty, China's last ruling family.</p><p>The large green bowl carved with writhing dragons dates from 1769 and has a Chinese poem written inside, while the sculpture is of seven fairies in a boat, beautifully crafted in translucent porcelain with a creamy glaze and standing about 30cm (12in) high. The bowl was obtained in China by Sir Charles Hardinge, a diplomat in the early 20th century who was noted for his early admiration for Gandhi. Hardinge also collected pottery and precious stones.</p><p>Detective Superintendent Adrian Green of Durham police <a href=\"http://www.durham.police.uk/press/news.php?id=2178&amp;area=1&amp;station=3\" title=\"\">said</a>: \"It seems very clear that this was a well planned, highly organised break-in. They have spent around 40 minutes creating a hole in an outside wall and, when it has been big enough, they have entered the gallery and made straight for these two items.</p><p>\"I am sure this job has been planned for quite some time and I would think the artefacts have been stolen to order, for someone who has already identified a potential market.\"</p><p>One of the people arrested, a 27-year-old man from Walsall, was questioned at a police station in County Durham on suspicion of assisting an offender, and has been released on police bail until June. The other four, a 34-year-old woman and three men aged 56, 41 and 36, were released on bail until June after being questioned in Durham on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary.</p><p>The museum's curator, Dr Craig Barclay, said after the theft: \"We are extremely upset to have fallen victim to such a serious crime. The two pieces are highly significant in that they are fine examples of artefacts from the Qing dynasty in the mediums of porcelain and hard stone.</p><p>\"We very much hope that police will be able to recover them and we urge anybody who may have any information about their whereabouts to contact the police immediately.\"</p><p>The museum was closed over Easter, usually a busy period, because of the theft.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Crime&k=Museums&k=Durham+University&k=Higher+education&k=Education&k=Culture\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Specialist+criminals+stole+%C2%A32m+Chinese+artefacts+from+university%2C+say+police+Article+1729666&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=Crime+-+UK+%28News%29%2CMuseums+%28Culture%29%2CDurham+University%2CHigher+education+%28Universities+etc.%29%2CEducation%2CCulture%2CUK+news%2CSculpture+%28Art+and+design%29%2CArt+and+design&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Martin+Wainwright&c7=12-Apr-11&c8=1729666&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/11/2m-chinese-artefacts-durham-university|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|81682594af1ed8f4c30325783faa069ab85da9df -->",

You can use the free version of the app to flash ClockworkMod Recovery on your device, reboot into recovery, install ROMs, or manage backups.</p></blockquote><p> This was flagged to us on Twitter as indicating that Cyanogenmod will \"soon be mainstream\". Our response: 99.9x% of Android users will never, ever mod their phones. They wouldn't even understand that extract.</p><h2><a href=\"http://blogs.smartmoney.com/advice/2012/04/10/with-instagram-facebook-gets-holy-grail-of-data/\">With Instagram, Facebook gets 'holy grail' of data - real-time advice &gt;&gt; SmartMoney</a></h2><blockquote><p>Snap a digital photo, and the file typically includes embedded information on where and when it was taken. Facebook says Instagram will remain a standalone app separate from the social networking site, but the acquisition could make it easier for marketers, advertisers and the apps and companies one \"likes\" to access that kind of photo information, says Deborah Mitchell, executive director for the Center of Brand and Product Management at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p></blockquote><p> Could be worth anywhere from $50 to $5,000 per user, apparently, because it says where you are (if you turn on location capture) and what you're interested in.

Nearly universally Mac users are and have been, concerned about security and malware.</p><p> So where does this myth come from? I think it's 3 sources.</p></blockquote><p> Read the three sources before you comment.</p><h2><a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120410/bye-bye-thrive-tablets-hello-toshiba-excite/\">Bye-bye, Thrive tablets; hello, Toshiba Excite &gt;&gt; AllThingsD</a></h2><p>Remember the crazy sales of the Toshiba Thrive tablet? Anyway. </p><blockquote><p>Toshiba's new Excite line, which the Japanese electronics maker is officially announcing today, will include 7.7-inch, 10-inch and 13-inch models. All three Wi-Fi-only tablets are running Google's Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system; they are aluminum-encased, have Gorilla Glass displays, come with a five-megapixel rear camera and a two-megapixel front-facing camera, and include new Nvidia TegraTM 3 processors.</p><p> The Excite 7.7 also has an AMOLED display, a micro-USB port and a micro-SD card slot; while the Excite 10 has an LED-backlit display, micro-USB and micro-HDMI ports, and a full-sized SD card slot. At 1.32 pounds, the new 10-inch weighs just slightly less than Toshiba's last tablet.</p></blockquote><p> Great specifications. Gartner's prediction: iPads (no AMOLED, no built-in micro-SD or HDMI ports) will outsell Android tablets 2:1 in 2012.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2012/04/09/poll-people-like-google-more-than-apple-or-facebook-with-chart-and-full-results\">Poll: People like Google more than Apple or Facebook [with chart and full results] &gt;&gt; DWMedia</a></h2><p>Appears to be a statistically rigorous poll: </p><blockquote><p>In addition to very broad popularity, Google and Apple share vast exposure. Just 10% of Americans haven't formed a basic opinion of Google (rising to 29% of less tech-savvy seniors), and 14% have no opinion of Apple and Facebook alike.

        "body":"<p>Barack Obama embarked on a full day of election campaigning in Florida, a key swing state, hammering Mitt Romney and the Republicans over their support for tax breaks for millionaires.</p><p>The Obama re-election campaign had treated Romney as the likely nominee for months, apart from an occasional wobble as Rick Santorum scored surprise wins. But with Santorum out of the race Tuesday, Obama knows with certainty who his opponent will be in February.</p><p>Obama targeted Romney in a speech at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton in which he highlighted the so-called \"Buffett rule\": that millionaires and billionaires should not be paying lower tax rates than working-class Americans. The rule is named for billionaire investor Warren Buffett.</p><p>Although Romney has wealth estimated at around $200m, he paid a tax rate of only 13.9% in 2010, less than many working-class Americans.</p><p>Congress is scheduled to vote on the \"Buffett rule\" on Monday, but it is opposed by Republicans and has no chance of passing. The proposed legislation would mean that millionaires would pay at least the same percentage in taxes as working-class families.</p><p>\"It's time for us to choose which direction we want to go in as a country,\" Obama said, rehearsing what is shaping up as a major general election theme. \"Do we want to keep giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans like me, or Warren Buffett or Bill Gates \u2013 people who don't need them and never asked for them? Or do we want to keep investing in things that will grow our economy and keep us secure? That's the choice.\"</p><p>He dismissed the idea that prosperity would trickle down from a wealthy few: it has always come from a strong and growing working-class, he said.</p><p>The White House press spokesman, Jay Carney, acknowledged Tuesday that Senate approval for the \"Buffett rule\" was \"an uphill battle\", though he added that constituents could put pressure on Republican members of Congress.</p><p>Republicans argue that even if millionaires and billionaires paid more, the impact on the deficit would be minimal. The White House says the tax rise would be worth $47bn over 10 years.</p><p>The White House presented the speech as official business, but it was basically a campaign speech, buttressed at either end by fundraising events. Three fundraising events were expected to raise about $2m.</p><p>The Obama campaign wants to portray the Republicans as the party of the wealthy and the president as the champion of the middle classes.<br />Republicans counter that the tax issue is a diversion and the Obama administration should be focused on jobs and the economy, which they claim will be the main interest of voters in November.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Barack+Obama&k=Florida&k=Warren+Buffett&k=Business&k=US+politics&k=US+elections+2012\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Obama+targets+millionaires+and+Romney+in+speech+at+Florida+university+Article+1729568&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Barack+Obama+%28News%29%2CFlorida+%28News%29%2CWarren+Buffett%2CBusiness%2CUS+politics%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CUS+Congress%2CUS+taxation+%28News%29%2CUS+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729568&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/10/obama-millionaire-tax-breaks-romney|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|8519a15d7c689e185e22bd9d4025fe0557c1ce5d -->",

        "body":"<p>Newt Gingrich has cheekily called on Rick Santorum's supporters to throw their weight behind him to prevent Mitt Romney becoming the Republican presidential nominee.</p><p>Gingrich repeatedly split the rightwing vote with Santorum, allowing Romney to win state after state that he might otherwise have lost if faced with only one of them.</p><p>Santorum, who won 11 states to only two taken by Gingrich, expressed frustration that there was no single candidate for conservatives to unite behind, and repeatedly urged Gingrich to stand aside.</p><p>But it is too late for either of them. Even with Santorum out of the race, Gingrich's campaign collapsed last month when, portraying himself as a southern candidate, he failed to win either Mississippi or Alabama.</p><p>He has since only been going through the motions, with donations having dried up.  </p><p>In a statement Tuesday, he praised Santorum for having fought a spirited campaign. He added: \"I am committed to staying in this race all the way to Tampa so that the conservative movement has a real choice.</p><p>\"I humbly ask Senator Santorum's supporters to visit newt.org to review my conservative record and join us as we bring these values to Tampa. We know well that only a conservative can protect life, defend the constitution, restore jobs and growth and return to a balanced budget.\"</p><p>In an interview with Fox on Sunday, Gingrich described Romney as \"far and away the most likely Republican nominee\".  </p><p>When he ceased campaigning in any meaningful sense, Gingrich said he hoped that there might still be a showdown if Romney fell short of the 1,144 majority of delegates needed in Tampa. But he admitted on Sunday that if that failed to happen, he would fall in behind Romney in the campaign against Obama.</p><p>Last month Gingrich was much more bullish about his prospects and dismissive of Romney's status as frontrunner. He predicted that Romney would fail to secure the 1,144 delegates, that the decision would be brokered at the convention and that Romney was not much of a frontrunner, having done poorly in the Mississippi and Louisiana primaries.</p><p>Jay Bookman, a columnist on the Atlanta Constitution-Journal, <a href=\"http://blogs.ajc.com/jay-bookman-blog/2012/03/29/the-gingrich-political-career-now-at-an-end/\">wrote recently</a>: \"He [Gingrich] has no money and in fact his campaign is deeply in debt. He lacks the resources to travel, let alone buy campaign ads, and the press has abandoned him, raising the age-old question: if a man utters pearls of profound wisdom, and no-one is there to hear him, did he really utter them at all? Yet still he presses on, insistent against all evidence that he remains relevant.\" </p><p>Fox News labels Gingrich's bid as \"the zombie campaign\". The question now, is whether the zombie will finally lay down and die.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Newt+Gingrich&k=Mitt+Romney&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&k=Republicans&k=US+elections+2012&k=US+politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Newt+Gingrich+to+Rick+Santorum+supporters%3A+vote+for+me+Article+1729566&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Newt+Gingrich%2CMitt+Romney+%28News%29%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CRepublicans+%28US%29%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CUS+politics%2CUS+national+security%2CWorld+news%2CUS+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729566&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/10/newt-gingrich-rick-santorum-vote-for-me|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|2190e468abef93731b5fac1a194c9d19a2c79540 -->",

        "body":"<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for those who are watching season five of Mad Men on Sky Atlantic. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode four</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/apr/03/mad-men-season-five-episode-three\" title=\"\">Paul MacInnes's episode three blog</a></p><h2>Mystery Date<br /></h2><p>A busy week, but let's start with Sally Draper and <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/grandma-pauline\" title=\"\">Grandma Pauline</a>. It wasn't the central narrative in this episode, and it certainly wasn't the most dramatic (I guess throttling an ex-lover to death claims that prize), but it was a most interesting coming together of characters driven by some wonderful acting, especially on the part of 11-year-old Kiernan Shipka.</p><p>The setup has been prefigured. Grandma Pauline has been looming in the shadows of the haunted mansion since last season; strict, sceptical and, let's face it, no oil painting, she is Betty's nemesis. This week however, Betty is in Buffalo. Sally is left at home and Granny is in charge. The encounter starts off combative and ends up trusting, but the way in which it develops sheds further light on how Sally is no mummy's girl.</p><p>We first see Sally in this episode complaining to her father about Pauline's overbearing behaviour. She does so assertively and with the odd snide aside \"[She] wears so much perfume\". So far so Betty. Next Sally is confronted by Pauline in ogre mode, slapping her hands for attempting to read the newspaper and snapping 'Some things are not for children\". The next assault occurs as Sally's view of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHsQpTbQ9Uo\" title=\"\">Mystery Date</a> (will someone spare the young from premature sexualisation!) is disturbed by Pauline's not so discreet discussion of the Chicago nurse murders. Conversation eventually turns to what we know is underlying all this tension, Pauline's disdain for Betty's parenting. She tells Sally that she would benefit from having some discipline in her life. Sally bridles. Pauline goes further, recalling a piece of casual paternal violence:</p><p>Pauline: He woke up and said; \"that's for nothing, so look out.\"</p><p>Sally: \"That's not very nice.\"</p><p>Pauline: \"No, but it was valuable advice.\"</p><p>The look on Sally's face as she hears this is the highlight of the hour. It's shock and fear, obviously, but it's also intrigue \u2013 in what kind of world might such a thing happen? \u2013 and then a final flash of what looks like calculation, as if the girl is working out whether such advice might actually be useful.</p><p>Now there's the characteristic whiff of feminine Mad Men self-loathing in that exchange, but still. By the end of the hour Pauline has formed a bond with Sally so great that they can get doped up on sleeping tablets. Along the way Pauline reveals herself to be a forthright woman of the world, and Sally someone willing to pay attention. Pauline, it turns out, makes demands of Sally, but she also treats her with respect. Sally responds positively to this. It will be interesting to see where the two go from here.</p><h2>Goodbye to Greg</h2><p>He came, he looked ripped, he left forever. The collapse of Joan's tangled marriage with Greg Harris was quick and, as was to be expected, unpleasant. As with his original enlisting, Greg did not consult Joan over his decision to stay in Vietnam for another year. The approbation of his peers (20 men look up to him, at last) mattered more than that of his wife. Joan's shock was as real as her determination to be the good wife during his shore leave, but you can't help but think; good riddance to bad, bad rubbish. What's more, the whole paternity thing now gets a degree less thorny.</p><h2>The Joy of Ginzo</h2><p>Michael Ginsberg, mouthy genius. That appears to be the size of things after the new hire wowed a prospective shoe, sorry, footwear client with a double pitch that drilled straight into the female id. Or so all the men in the room thought anyway.</p><p>In his second pitch, the \"too dark\" one, we see Draper-esque psychological conjuring, the difference being that Mike apparently \"gets\" women. Cinderella is being pursued down a dark alley, but yet \"she wants to be caught\". Her pursuer is not attractive but still seductive (perhaps a bit like our Mike?). It's his pursuit that has a power over Cinderella, that and the fact he's found her missing slipper.</p><p>The pitch is snapped up right away, a bollocking from Don follows shortly afterwards. The pretext is insubordination, taking the meeting in an unexpected direction. The subtext is obsolescence, Don raging at the younger colleague with the fresh new ideas. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/24/mad-men-matthew-weiner\" title=\"\">Matthew Weiner</a> has talked about this broader idea, the fear of becoming outmoded, and Don's reaction seems to play into that. For my money, I think the relationship between the two will prove to be more subtle than a straight-up oedipal conflict. Hey, they just might learn something from each other.</p><h2>Don's dream</h2><p>Sorry, but I didn't dig on this. Don is consigned to bed with a fever and a cough that, if this were a TV movie, would turn out to be the early stages of lung cancer. Instead it's a device with which the show can explore Don's commitment or otherwise to his new life of monogamy. That and chuck a bit of raunch in.</p><p>Probing Don's sexual morals is an entirely legitimate area for exploration and, one might say, central to Mad Men as a whole. To do it in his sleep, however, just seems like a cop out. Is it entirely impossible for an encounter with an assertive ex-lover to have happened during waking hours? It would have required a more nuanced resolution than either denial or death by strangulation, but I think that would have been more in keeping with the show. As it was, however, I felt we learned nothing but got fed some eye candy and eye-bulging violence as a substitute.</p><h2>This week's other notes</h2><p>Top bantz between Roger and Peggy. Is Roger now officially being played for laughs?</p><p>I like Stan Rizzo. Even when he's wearing pantyhose like some kind of mugger.</p><p>I also like Joyce Ramsay. Her nicknames are great (Paggasus!). This week it was her turn to wear the bad check jacket.</p><h2>Time stamps</h2><p>Another disappointing element to the hour was the way in which background events were shoved so heavily to the foreground. Particularly the repeated exposition regarding the killing of eight student nurses from South Chicago Community Hospital by one <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Speck\" title=\"\">Richard Speck</a>. The murders caused panic and wild speculation (about Speck's genetic make up among other things) but are now largely forgotten. Which may explain the exposition, but didn't stop it from feeling a bit heavy.</p><p>\"I think this will get on the cover rather than the riots\", says Joyce Ramsay while doling out Speck photos to the SCDP youngsters (interestingly, Megan included). She goes on to say that \"there's been five riots already this summer\" and we learn from Dawn that there are more, localised incidents which might not get reported, never mind appear on the cover of Time. The summer of 1966 does not match the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_Riots\" title=\"\">Watts riots</a> of the previous summer or the summer of 1968 in intensity, but it shows that this strain of civil disturbance was neither going away nor being heeded by the white ruling class.</p><p>These two incidents are, of course, brought together smartly for just one brief moment as Peggy confuses Dawn's very real fear of being attacked in her neighbourhood with the panic over Speck. That Peggy then follows it up by accusing her (with a solitary gaze at a handbag) of being a potential thief makes matters worse.</p><p>\"From July 8 to August 19, 1966 over 35,000 airline workers across the nation employed by five airlines went on strike.\" \u2013 I've pasted that straight from Wikipedia because this plot point was so dull that only Pete Campbell could get interested in it.</p><h2>Culture club</h2><p>\"I was discovered. Like Esther Blodgett\" \u2013 Peggy compares herself to Judy Garland in A Star is Born. Which must make the dipsomaniac James Mason character...</p><p>Mystery Date. I'm sure Sally's rapture at the TV ad might have had elements of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/oct/06/mad-men-season-four-episode-five\">Illya Kuryakin</a> about it, but she might also have wanted to get her hands on the <a href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7314/mystery-date\">Milton Bradley board game</a> where \"Depending on how the doorknob is rotated, a different guy will 'appear'.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio&k=Mad+Men&k=Television&k=Drama&k=Historical+drama&k=US+television&k=Television+%26+radio\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mad+Men%3A+season+five%2C+episode+four+Article+1729485&ch=Television+%26amp%3B+radio&c2=148491&c4=Mad+Men+%28TV%29%2CTelevision+%28Culture%29%2CDrama+%28TV+genre%29%2CHistorical+drama+%28TV+genre%29%2CUS+television+%28TV+and+radio%29%2CTelevision+and+radio+TV%2CCulture&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Paul+MacInnes&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729485&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/apr/10/mad-men-season-five-episode-four|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|8dce65f34c949c269d33be21e4ba211a7c6ea5a3 -->",

        "headline":"Rick Santorum bows to the inevitable and quits Republican presidential race",
        "body":"<p>Mitt Romney looks certain to be the Republican candidate facing Barack Obama in the fight for the White House in November after his last serious rival, Rick Santorum, bowed to the inevitable and quit the race for their party's nomination. </p><p>After a bruising campaign that began in Iowa on January 3, Santorum declared at a press conference in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania: \"The race is over for me.\" The decision leaves Romney with a clear route to the Republican nomination at the party convention in August.</p><p>Flanked by his family and close aides, Santorum said: \"We made the decision to get into this race at our kitchen table against all the odds, and we made a decision over the weekend that while this presidential race is over for me \u2013 and we will suspend our campaign effective today \u2013 we're not done fighting,\" adding he would continue to battle have his socially conservative views heard.</p><p>Romney, freed from the distraction of having to campaign in the Republican race, will now be able to focus his energy and funds on the battle with Obama. He must now hope that the deep GOP divisions exposed in the primaries and caucuses can be bridged, and that the Republican party will unite behind him.</p><p>The former Massachusetts governor can depend on the party millionaires who regard Obama as too left-wing to pile in behind him, ready to fund one of the biggest negative ad campaigns in US political history. The question is whether the party grassroots \u2013 who regard Romney as too moderate \u2013 will join the rally behind him.</p><p>Romney has much ground to make up. Obama's re-election campaign team, based in Chicago, has been building networks of supporters in the swing states, and Obama himself has been out on the campaign trail for months. As Santorum was delivering his resignation speech, Obama was taking to the stage at an event in Florida.</p><p>The president, in a speech at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, hammered the Republicans over their protection of tax breaks for millionaires, which Obama intends to make a key election issue \u2013 one he hopes will define the difference between Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>\"It's time for us to choose which direction we want to go in as a country,\" Obama said. \"Do we want to keep giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans like me, or Warren Buffett, or Bill Gates \u2013 people who don't need them and never asked for them?  Or do we want to keep investing in things that will grow our economy and keep us secure?  That's the choice.\"</p><p>He did not mention Romney or his wealth directly, but the implication was clear.</p><p>Obama held fundraising events on either side of the speech, bringing in an estimated $1.9m.</p><p>Polls show Obama with significant leads over Romney, particularly among women. The outcome could be determined by whether the economy continues to recover over the summer and autumn.</p><p>Santorum, in his Gettysburg remarks, did not offer support or endorsement of Romney by name. </p><p>In a statement minutes after Santorum finished his speech, Romney was gracious: \"Senator Santorum is an able and worthy competitor, and I congratulate him on the campaign he ran. He has proven himself to be an important voice in our party and in the nation.\"</p><p>Romney consistently outspent Santorum and other rivals in advertising, by margins of four-to-one or higher. Romney's campaign, and the nominally independent political action committee that supports it, are estimated to have spent more than $30m.   </p><p>Official figures for March are due out later this week but Time magazine, based on returns submitted to the end of February, estimated that the Romney campaign spent $17.14 per voter compared with $2.54 for Santorum.</p><p>Santorum has been a stubborn opponent, winning a string of states, including Iowa, with his under-funded campaign contrasting with Romney's millions.  </p><p>He won 11 states, including victories in Colorado and Minnesota in February and Alabama and Mississippi in March. His departure brings to an end a race that produced lots of ups and downs, with Republicans replacing one another as party favourite with on a frequent basis dating back to the Ames straw poll in Iowa in August.   </p><p>Congresswoman Michele Bachmann gave way as party favourite to Texas governor Rick Perry, who in turn was replaced by pizza mogul Herman Cain and then former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \"This race was as improbable as any race you will see for president,\" Santorum told reporters in Gettysburg. He was the most socially conservative of the candidates, his anti-gay and anti-abortion views winning a core of supporters among Christian evangelicals.</p><p>Santorum said he was suspending his campaign rather than quitting, a technicality that allows him to continue fundraising to clear his campaign debts.   </p><p>Gingrich is still theoretically in the Republican race, but has all but given up campaigning, and admitted weeks ago that Romney would win. The outsider, Congressman Ron Paul, said he will remain in the race, fighting his own idiosyncratic campaign but is so far behind he stands no chance of catching Romney.</p><p>Paul congraluted Santorum on a \"spirited campaign\" and insisted he planned to press the fight all the way to the party convention in Florida in August.</p><p>Santorum cited as one of his reasons for leaving the race his daughter Bella, who is seriously ill and who spent the weekend in hospital before being discharged on Monday.   </p><p>But his exit was also an acknowledgement of the brutal arithmetic. When he failed to win the Illinios primary last month, Romney's lead became insurmountable. Santorum refused at the time to quit, hoping to win Pennsylvania in a fortnight, but polls showed his initial advantage disappearing, and it would have been a major embarrassment for him to have lost his home state.</p><p>There will be speculation that Romney might pick him as his vice-presidential running mate, or even as a member of his cabinet, though that would be awkward given the comments Santorum has made about him, including the charge that Romney has no core principles.</p><p>Santorum may instead treat the 2012 race as a practice run for 2016, though he would need to widen his appeal beyond socially conservative Republicans.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Rick+Santorum&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&k=Republicans&k=US+elections+2012&k=United+States&k=US+politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Rick+Santorum+bows+to+the+inevitable+and+quits+Republican+presidential+race+Article+1729552&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Rick+Santorum%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CRepublicans+%28US%29%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CUS+politics%2CWorld+news%2CBarack+Obama+%28News%29%2CMitt+Romney+%28News%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729552&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/10/rick-santorum-quits-republican-race|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|d90bb33339bfdcfd7e5303c4a2121b311a3a2efe -->",

        "trailText":"Charlie Alcock, psychologist and charity founder, says gangs should not be dismantled but adapted to do social good",
        "headline":"Mental health treatment gets street smart",
        "body":"<p>Four years ago, Charlie Alcock was spat on, ignored, had pebbles thrown at her and was suspected of being an undercover police officer by the north London gang she was trying to strike up a conversation with by hanging around their fish and chip shop of choice.</p><p>The incongruity of a privately educated, academically high-achieving, white woman raised in rural Gloucestershire appearing from nowhere and saying she wanted their help was clearly not lost on the group of two dozen or so urban young men, who had  struggled to stay in school and spent most of their days smoking cannabis and getting into trouble. It took six months before one member of the group even asked her, \"in a not very polite way\", what she was doing there.</p><p>Alcock, an NHS psychologist who wanted to start up a social enterprise tackling the causes of youth crime, gave him the short version: that although there were services aimed at his group, they weren't working. \"And I think you know what works,\" she told him.</p><p>Over the next few months, the teenager became a go-between, conveying ideas between Alcock and his peers about what sort of a project they wanted to set up, eventually settling on music.</p><p>The music group was the genesis of <a href=\"http://www.musicandchange.com/\" title=\"\">Mac-UK</a>, the charity Alcock subsequently founded in 2008 in collaboration with the young people involved in gangs. It was a way to engage with them and build relationships in order to start working with them on mental health issues.</p><p>Alcock wanted to find new ways to address the link between mental health and youth offending. \"The group that was of great interest to me was young offenders, and the fact that one in three young people who offend have an unmet mental health need at the time of offence,\" she says.</p><p>Treatment or, as Alcock terms it, \"street therapy\" needed to be administered wherever young people would feel comfortable \u2013 whether in fish and chip shops or on park benches. It is a long haul. Alcock admits that \"even now there are young people we've known for three years and they are only just beginning to work with us\".</p><p>The Mac-UK programme works intensively for as long as two years with about 30 young \"severely deprived\" people aged between 16 and 25, often homeless. All have refused traditional offers of help. Street therapy is central to the project, with young people self-referring and deciding when, where and for how long they would like to meet.</p><p>Her insight into how she might better reach young offenders came while working on an \"alternative to incarceration\" project in New York during her clinical training. There, one young man told her that as a result of talking to psychologists like her, his cousin had been killed for \"snitching\".</p><p>\"Until you can find a way to work with us that's safe, you might as well go home because you're actually putting us at more risk than if you weren't here,\" she recalls him saying.</p><p>For people on the margins of society there's a distrust of public services \u2013 either because of a bad experience with the authorities or from fear of imprisonment, says Alcock. The only way to reach them was to become part of the furniture of their lives.</p><p>Alcock views gangs as enterprises whose goals needs fixing rather than as ventures that need to be disbanded. Gangs might be criminal in outlook but, she argues, they can be transformed into community organisations, responding to people's needs.</p><p>\"It's about what the group does. So the whole idea of Mac is that gradually the peer group begins to do something more pro-social, collectively. Rather than dealing drugs, carrying weapons, they're setting up a music project or whatever it might be,\" she says. The young people use their DJ skills to run the music sessions themselves, employed by Mac-UK.</p><p>From dealing with troubled teenagers Alcock can see that on the street there is an explosive mix of heavy skunk [cannabis] use, frightening levels of domestic violence growing up and clinical depression. Some youngsters speak of hearing voices, others admit self-harm.</p><p>\"This group have often grown up with lack of adult role models, found school particularly challenging, and you mix some of those risk factors with environments of real threat \u2013 which is what gangs create, and you add skunk as self-treatment, then it's no wonder that a lot of these young people do have issues with mental health,\" she explains.</p><p>To engage such disaffected and chaotic young people, the 16-strong Mac-UK team, which includes psychologists, youth workers and volunteers, seeks to win their trust by taking part in whatever group activity is taking place. \"So [if] there's a gym group, we have mental health workers on the treadmill \u2013 going quite slow,\" says Alcock.</p><p>Once a bond has been established, Mac-UK sessions with trained staff can occur anywhere. These \"might take place on buses, benches, stairwells. We might go with a young person to court \u2013 waiting for four hours to be seen by the judge is an amazing opportunity to do work,\" she says. \"The young people definitely trust me now [and] others in the team,\" she adds.</p><p>As well as providing mental health support to those who need it and improving their access to mainstream services, Mac-UK aims to reduce re-offending and get the young people into employment, education or training. Three-quarters of the first cohort moved into training, education or employment \u2013 albeit temporarily for some. Three of the young men on the music scheme have gone on to set up their own successful project \u2013 Mini Mac \u2013 which delivers music and mental health awareness into schools.</p><p>It is a persuasive pitch from an assertive 32-year-old social entrepreneur, bidding to solve some of society's most intractable problems. As Alcock says: \"Five per cent of young people cause 95% of youth crimes, and it's that 5% that we work with.\"</p><p>Her approach, which has been funded by the <a href=\"http://www.phf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Paul Hamlyn Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.camden.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Camden council</a>, is now being evaluated by the <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Mental Health Foundation</a>. It is also being piloted in another area of north London with a plan to set up a further three projects in the capital in the next 18 months. The projects will be in partnership with staff from council and NHS services, who Mac-UK will take under its wing and introduce to the young people.</p><p>\"They're often young people who are homeless or have moved out of their family situation, so they're often in young persons' hostels or sleeping on friends' sofas, occasionally rough sleeping. In our experience, if one of this group was homeless it's going to be the local drug dealer that gives them a room. That is how it works,\" says&nbsp;Alcock.</p><p>Her Mac-UK model can be adapted at a local level, she says, because it is \"grown from the ground up\" by the young people that it seeks to help. She adds: \"I want it to become the status quo for working with this demographic.\"</p><h2><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></h2><p><strong>Age</strong> 32.</p><p><strong>Lives</strong> North-west London.</p><p><strong>Family</strong> Engaged.</p><p><strong>Education</strong> Cheltenham ladies college; Warwick University, sociology degree; Oxford Brookes University, psychology conversion; Salomons campus \u2013 Canterbury Christ Church University, PhD in clinical psychology, specialising in community psychology.</p><p><strong>Career</strong> 2008-present: chief executive, Mac-UK; 2007-08: clinical psychologist, Camden and Islington NHS foundation trust, assertive outreach team for adults with severe and enduring mental health issues.</p><p><strong>Public life</strong> Member of the independent advisory network for the Home Office's ending gang violence team.</p><p><strong>Interests</strong> Snow-boarding and crafts, including making cards, candles and bath bombs.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/society&k=Mental+health&k=Gangs&k=Communities&k=Young+people&k=Health&k=Society\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/society/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/society/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mental+health+treatment+gets+street+smart+Article+1728950&ch=Society&c2=148491&c4=Mental+health+%28Society%29%2CGangs+%28Society%29%2CCommunities+%28Society%29%2CYoung+people+%28Society%29%2CHealth+%28Society%29%2CSociety&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Raekha+Prasad&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1728950&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: society/2012/apr/10/mental-health-street-smart-charlie-alcock|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|cb7fab9029d2125716410d98d86ee7fc2b2fa4be -->",

        "body":"<p>A professor friend of mine was telling me recently how popular he was with his vice-chancellor. Not, he stressed, because of his respectable smattering of reasonably original papers in journals with quite short titles. Nor for his teaching, since he hardly did any. No. It was the money he raised.</p><p>This is a top table topic at present in academia, as Guardian science contributors have noted. \"Can basic research be saved from the tyranny of the profit motive?\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/feb/23/scientists-basic-research-business\" title=\"\">asked, for example, Nature's Ananyo Bhattacharya in February</a>, lamenting the perennial cash crisis of blue skies.</p><p>But don't ask me how much my pal raised, or the paws from which he prised it. Although I know it was the usual tens and hundreds of grand from a balanced portfolio of industry, government and charity sources, common courtesy discouraged further inquiry. In truth, I don't care. But somebody might. In which case, tough luck on them.</p><p>Although triumphant in the common room over their front-of-the-plane funding, successful science academics (particularly in biosciences) are often as publicly transparent about the paymasters behind their publishing as chefs are about rats behind the fridge.</p><p>This isn't news. The evidence is overwhelming. You could build yourself a treehouse of printed worries. And even Francis Collins, director of the US National Institutes of Health, has called for compulsory online registers of researchers' interests as a condition of federal funding. \"The public may not always understand the intricacies of rigorous science,\" <a href=\"http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/303/23/2400\" title=\"\">he wrote two years ago</a>, \"but most individuals quickly grasp the concept of bias.\"</p><p>What came of his proposal? <a href=\"http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/08/new-us-conflict-of-interest-rule.html\" title=\"\">Pretty much zilch</a>. So, was there a storm in science media? Of course not. Though weeping like clockwork crocodiles over the murky side of mullah, science editors couldn't give a monkey's backside. Why would they? Why would, say, Nature fret over who picks up its authors' tabs, so long as it isn't its behemoth publisher, <a href=\"http://www.macmillan.com/\" title=\"\">MacMillan</a>?</p><p>As long as scientists get more money (which I think was Bhattacharya's point) and the idea doesn't get round that most science articles are advertising, the tobacco industry's dosh is the same colour as Marie Curie's. All it needs is a good scrub for opacity. More worrying to journal editors would be any dent in reader loyalty triggered by stirring public pressures to disclose.</p><p>I have a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563288/?tool=pubmed\" title=\"\">favourite paper</a> from seven years ago which opened a tiny window on all this. <a href=\"http://grovevetshighpeak.com/the-team\" title=\"\">Sue Mayer</a>, now an English Peak District vet, checked six months' worth of Nature reports on genetics and molecular biology against authors' patent interests filed elsewhere. It wasn't life's biggest study. She didn't find the Higgs Boson. But what she did find should make you wince.</p><p>Working with the <a href=\"http://www.genewatch.org/\" title=\"\">GeneWatch</a> group, she calculated that an astonishing two thirds of authors with a related patent claim hadn't felt moved to declare this in their papers. \"The research reported here,\" she concluded in the <a href=\"http://jme.bmj.com/\" title=\"\">Journal of Medical Ethics</a>, \"indicates that failure to report competing financial interests in original research published in Nature is the norm, not the exception.\"</p><p>And what was the reaction to this dazzling snapshot? She tells me: \"They took not the slightest bit of notice.\"</p><p>Which brings me back to my pal the professor, or more particularly to his delighted vice-chancellor. With nobody but a public, perhaps to be swindled or maimed, with much stake in who's paying whom, I fear our best chance of disinfecting science with light must lie in academia itself.</p><p>Although the White House last year dumped on Collins's plan, the self-evident innovation would be for the institutions themselves to introduce compulsory registers. Some units already have them, in a haphazard kind of way, but every university should have a publicly searchable database of academics' external sources of money.</p><p>Competing commercial interests would then be readily checkable, saving labours such as Mayer's. This is obvious. And every kind of funder, from children's charities to GlaxoSmithKline, could be back-tracked for influence, year-on-year.</p><p>The gristle in the pasty, of course, is that academics run academia. And they're not exactly jostling to log their interests. That would be a step closer to league tables and sub-specialty beauty contests \u2013 in which those with enough stats might dread falling below the median, risking inquiries that manners surely forbid.</p><p>Academics also manage, however, and there's big bucks to be had there (and, for British men, that wondrous title \"Professor Sir\"). But for those males who wish to excel (while making their wives a Lady), my friend reckons the opportunity to use a register to fire people may be no less enticing than the dough.</p><p></p><p><em>Brian Deer's website is </em><a href=\"http://briandeer.com/\" title=\"\"><em>briandeer.com</em></a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/science&k=Science&k=Science&k=Education&k=Higher+education&k=Biosciences\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/science/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/science/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=It%27s+time+for+a+register+of+interests+for+science+academics+%7C+Brian+Deer+Article+1729265&ch=Science&c2=148491&c4=Science%2CScience+%28Education+subject%29%2CEducation%2CHigher+education+%28Universities+etc.%29%2CBiosciences+%28Education+subject%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Brian+Deer&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729265&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: science/2012/apr/10/register-of-interests-science-academics|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|14c9b8c0b8eeb35e71afc5a3e4b28e7dea943186 -->",

The exhibition has nine interactive galleries \u2013 visitors can walk through the original Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard gates, take a six-minute Shipyard Ride through different parts of the ship, with the sounds of riveting and smells of metal burning, and see replicas of the first-, second- and third-class cabins. There's also a glass floor with video footage of the Titanic on the seabed.</p><p>Next door, the Titanic Slipways, where the ship and her sister ship Olympic were built, have been landscaped with lights, grass and decking to show the outlines of the actual ships. A few minutes away is Titanic's Dock and Pump-House (<a href=\"http://www.titanicsdock.com/\" title=\"\">titanicsdock.com</a>, tickets from £5 adults, £3 children, £12 families), where you can peer down into the 880ft graving dock where Titanic sat for her final fit out. The best way to explore the Titanic Quarter is to take a tour \u2013 a two-hour walking tour includes access to the Dock and Pump-House and also to the Harland and Wolff drawing offices (0754 648 9874,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.titanicwalk.com\" title=\"\">titanicwalk.com</a>, adults £12, children £5-£8, families £30).&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Titanica exhibition at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum in Cultra, east of the city, you can also hear audio recordings of stories told by the survivors, and there is an exhibition of some original artefacts that were recovered from the ship, including a porthole and soup tureen (<a href=\"http://www.nmni.com/uftm#TITANICa--The-Exhibition\" title=\"\">nmni.com</a>.from £6.50 per adult and £4 per child, £13-£18.50 families).</p><h2>The MAC</h2><p>On 22 April the MAC arts centre will open&nbsp;with a new play by Belfast-born playwright Owen McCafferty about the Titanic Inquiry. The script of the play, Titanic: Scenes From The British Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry 1912, is based on survivors' testimony given at the inquiry in London. The hearing took 36 days and involved nearly 100 witnesses; this courtroom drama retells some of the human stories of bravery and frailty from the disaster. The Mac is in the buzzy St Anne's Square behind St Anne's Cathedral (see below). <br /><em>\u2022 10 Exchange Street West, St Anne's Square,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://themaclive.com/whats-on/titanic/\" title=\"\"><em>themaclive.com</em></a><em>. Tickets available from 22, 23 and 24 April from £9.50</em></p><h2>Titanic themed pubs and restaurants</h2><p>As well as official events, the city's pubs and restaurants have also jumped on the Titanic bandwagon \u2013 with varying degrees of, er, taste. The Merchant Hotel (028-9023 4888, <a href=\"http://www.themerchanthotel.com/index.php/offers-and-events.html\" title=\"\">themerchanthotel.com</a>) has been transformed into a \"ship\", the RMS Merchant, for the month of April. The five-star hotel has nautical bunting and RMS Merchant flags and staff are dressed in nautical uniforms. Guests checking in for the Titanic Experience package will receive a boarding pass with their key card and can have a Gin and Titonic cocktail (oh, yes!) in the \"A-Deck bar\". There's also a nine-course tasting menu based on the flavours of 1912, including dishes such as cold asparagus truffle vinaigrette, poached oysters, champagne and orange sorbet, and turbot and lamb à la Francaise (£85 with recommended wines, £65 without).</p><p>Over at the five-star Culloden Hotel in Holywood, there's a special \u2013 wait for it \u2013 Sips Ahoy! Titanic Afternoon Tea similar to that served onboard to first-class passengers, with sandwiches, pastries, Harlequin biscuits and Titanic cupcakes (£22 per head, 028-9042 1066, <a href=\"http://www.hastingshotels.com/culloden-estate-and-spa.html\" title=\"\">hastingshotels.com</a>). Also in Holywood, Rayanne House is offering a Titanic banquet  of nine courses, with everything from champagne-laced asparagus to foie gras and truffle and cream of barley soup finished with Bushmills whiskey and cream (£69 per head, various dates, <a href=\"http://www.rayannehouse.com/TitanicMenu.aspx\" title=\"\">rayannehouse.com</a>).</p><h2>The Linen Hall Library</h2><p>Founded in 1788, the Linen Hall, formerly a linen warehouse, is Belfast's oldest library. Entry is free and the cafe is currently running an exhibition of work by Belfast-born artist Terry Bradley, which features striking paintings of the faces of men who worked in the dockyards in Belfast and Dublin 100 years ago. The library also has a small exhibition of Titanic memorabilia and posters on show until 30 April.</p><p>On 19 April, Dr John Welshman, who wrote <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Titanic-Last-Night-Small-Town/dp/0199595577\" title=\"\">Titanic: The Last Night of a Small Town</a> (published last month), will give a talk about the stories of passengers and crew who survived (including the second officer, a first-class governess and a mother in third class) and what happened to them in the years afterwards. <br /><em>\u2022 17 Donegall Square North, free,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.linenhall.com/programme.asp\" title=\"\"><em>linenhall.com</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p><h2>Land Of Giants at the Titanic Slipways</h2><p>Rehearsals are under way for this outdoor summer event which will tell the story of the many giants of Belfast and Northern Ireland \u2013 from Finn McCool (the legendary warrior who built the Giant's Causeway) and Jonathan Swift's Gulliver (said to have been inspired by Cavehill which overlooks the city) to the Titanic and Olympic ships and the landmark Harland and Wolff shipyard cranes, also known as Samson and Goliath. The locations have been landscaped and lit to mirror the shape of the two ships that were built there, and a special stage made of shipping containers will be constructed. The audience will stand, divided between the two slipways, and at each end a crane will lift aerial performances into the air. During the 45-minute show, which starts at dusk, there will also be a specially commissioned animated film projected onto the Titanic Belfast building behind the slipways, as well as circus, music and pyrotechnics.&nbsp;<br /><em>\u2022 30 June 2012, doors open 9.30pm, £10 adults, £6 concessions, £28 families, Titanic Slipways Saturday 30th June 2012. </em><a href=\"http://www.landofgiants.info/\" title=\"\"><em>landofgiants.info</em></a><em>; tickets from&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.gotobelfast.com/whats-on/event/land-of-giants\" title=\"\"><em>gotobelfast.com</em></a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/travel&k=Belfast&k=Northern+Ireland&k=The+Titanic&k=United+Kingdom&k=Travel&k=Belfast\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/travel/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/travel/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=100+years+on%2C+The+Titanic+is+bigger+than+ever+in+Belfast++Article+1728929&ch=Travel&c2=148491&c4=Belfast+%28Travel%29%2CNorthern+Ireland+%28travel%29%2CTitanic+%28News%29%2CUnited+Kingdom+%28Travel%29%2CTravel%2CBelfast+%28news%29%2CUK+news%2CMuseums+%28Culture%29%2CCulture%2CFamily+holidays&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Yvonne+Gordon&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1728929&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: travel/2012/apr/10/titanic-events-100th-anniversary-belfast|2012-04-20T09:43:57Z|99a537983243493562797aa635b49139ead4f5e4 -->",

        "headline":"New wave of well-off Pakistani women drawn to conservative Islam",
        "body":"<p>All the women working in the information technology division of the Bank of Punjab's headquarters in the western Pakistani city of Lahore wear headscarves tightly wound around their cheeks and chin, framing their faces as they tap at their keyboards. A year or so ago not one covered their heads with the hijab.</p><p>\"I was the first,\" says 28-year-old Shumaila, as she waited with some impatience in the city's iStore for her new £800 Apple MacBook to be loaded with the software she had ordered.</p><p>\"I started reading the Qur'an properly and praying five times a day. No one made me wear the hijab. That would be impossible,\" she laughs brightly. \"I showed the way to the other girls at work.\"</p><p>They are not alone. Though there are no statistics and most evidence is anecdotal, a new wave of interest in more conservative strands of Islam among wealthier and better educated women in Pakistan appears clear.</p><p>It is part of a broader cultural and religious shift seen in the country over  decades but which observers say has accelerated in the past 10 years.</p><p>\"The other girls who were working with us left.\" Shumaila said. \"They found the new environment a bit unfriendly.\"</p><p>One indication of the trend is the growing proportion of women within the conservative religious political organisation Jamaat-e-Islami (JI). Syed Munawar Hassan, the leader of JI in Pakistan, said that women made up an increasing proportion of the organisation's 6 million members and 30,000 organisers. \"Our women's wing is doing very well,\" he said. \"They are some of our best organisers.\"</p><p>JI, like its counterparts elsewhere in the Islamic world, has traditionally recruited among the lower middle class, swollen in recent decades in Pakistan by rapid urbanisation and economic growth. But the new wave of devotion is now touching the elite in a new way. Al-Huda (The Guidance), an organisation set up in 1994 to spread a new and often rigorous piety among Pakistani women, has gained a foothold among the  upper reaches of society.</p><p>The group, which critics accuse of encouraging intolerant strands of Islam influenced by those practised in Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, has grown from an initial single small centre in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, to a presence in every city, and is expanding among the Pakistani diaspora abroad.</p><p>Members attend intensive courses in Qur'anic studies and Arabic and are directed to do social welfare work, too. Not all enjoy the experience of al-Huda, however.</p><p>\"I found it very limiting and rigid. But it is very popular among women from very wealthy families that are quite conservative. Recently there are a lot of young women coming to a very traditional Islam. There is a deep desire for learning,\" said Maha Jehangir, a 30-year-old consultant and former al-Huda member.</p><p>Jehangir, who lives in a large house in one of the most exclusive parts of Islamabad, said questions posed by the events of the past decade were particularly important for young women.</p><p>\"People who grew up within the war on terror are asking, what does it mean to be a Nato ally? Is India our worst enemy? We are bombarded by all this information and there is a deep need for answers. That leads to religious inquiry,\" Jehangir said.</p><p>Many found the answers in conservative strands of religious practice, she said.</p><p>Other influences that underpin the new piety among wealthy women include the experience of many Pakistanis who have spent time in the Gulf.</p><p>Amna, a 21-year-old business student whose father was a manager for a major firm in Saudi Arabia, said that it was wrong to think that women who were richer or more educated would inevitably be more secular.</p><p>\"Everything we learn comes from the Qur'an. Maths, computers, banking \u2013 the Qur'an contains everything,\" said Amna, who wears a Saudi-style full veil covering all but her eyes even at the all-female college in Islamabad where she studies.</p><p>However, if there is a demand for more rigorous, literalist strands of Islamic practice among wealthy and educated women, there is also an interest in more tolerant varieties.</p><p>In Lahore, the <a href=\"http://www.al-mawrid.org/\" title=\"\">al-Mawrid institute</a> is attracting more and more \"educated ladies, doctors, professors, housewives who do not know about Islam\", says Kaukab Shehzad, a 43-year-old teacher.</p><p>The institute, in the wealthy suburb of Model Town, was set up three years ago but had to move after receiving threats from radical scholars, she said. \"We read the Qur'an in detail but we discuss other religions too. We were attacked for saying that the niqab [Saudi-style veil] is not justified in the Qur'anic teachings and for arguing against their interpretation of the idea of jihad,\" she said.</p><p>Though solidarity with Muslim communities overseas is encouraged by many conservative practitioners, many of the new devout shun such a global vision and identity. Shumaila, the bank worker and Apple enthusiast, says she is not interested in events in the Middle East: \"We've enough going on here.\"</p><p>Jahangir, the former al-Huda member in Islamabad, recently spent two years studying in a religious school of the Deobandi branch of Islam, also followed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. A graduate of both Massachusetts and London Universities, she too said that political activism was of little interest: \"I don't try to make sense of the Taliban. I find [them] obscure and irrelevant. For me, [the Deobandi school of Islam] is far more of a route to spirituality than a political ideology.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Pakistan&k=Islam&k=Religion&k=Women&k=World+news&k=Life+and+style\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=New+wave+of+well-off+Pakistani+women+drawn+to+conservative+Islam+Article+1721629&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Pakistan+%28News%29%2CIslam+%28News%29%2CReligion+%28News%29%2CWomen+and+women%27s+interests%2CWorld+news%2CLife+and+style&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Jason+Burke+in+Lahore&c7=12-Apr-09&c8=1721629&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/09/pakistani-women-conservative-islam|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|0c752468a19f65ddb7652be8b17b011b11881d52 -->",

        "headline":"Manchester United v QPR \u2013 as it happened",
        "body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p>Early arrivals were offered this snippet from <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2012/apr/07/dissent-manchester-united-sir-alex-ferguson\">Paul Wilson's match preview</a> to tide them over, and I see no good reason to take it away now. So here it is.</p><blockquote><p>Manchester United have won 10 of their past 11 league games and drawn the other, not only displaying the sort of precisely timed acceleration that defines champions but giving their rivals an object lesson in team unity and professional focus. While United have moved five points clear at the top of the Premier League, Manchester City have been one of the sides caught arguing among themselves, with disappointing results leading to signs of dissent on and off the pitch.</p><p>It could be argued that good results promote team harmony, and vice versa, though even in adversity, or the occasions such as Monday evening at Blackburn when the leaders had to wait 80 minutes for a breakthrough, squabbling among United players is rare.</p><p>\"I wouldn't allow it,\" Sir Alex Ferguson says, speaking with all the authority of a manager who has faced down internal criticism from Roy Keane, Jaap Stam and others in his time. Even those cases tended to happen away from the pitch, in television studios or books. United players conspicuously fight for each other on the pitch, they do not turn on each other.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>The teams are in! </strong>And they look very much like this:<br /><strong>Manchester United:</strong> De Gea, Rafael Da Silva, Ferdinand, Evans, Evra, Valencia, Scholes, Carrick, Young, Rooney, Welbeck. <strong>Subs: </strong>Amos, Jones, Giggs, Park, Hernández, Cleverley, Pogba. <br /><strong>QPR:</strong> Kenny, Onuoha, Ferdinand, Hill, Taiwo, Diakite, Derry, Mackie, Taarabt, Buzsaky, Bothroyd. <strong>Subs: </strong>Cerny, Gabbidon, Campbell, Young, Smith, Wright-Phillips, Zamora. <br /><strong>Referee: </strong>Lee Mason.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.00pm:</span> <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/soundway-records/another-one-bites-the-dust-los\">Song of the day:</a> A good choice for this one should probably reflect Manchester United's potentially title-winning current form, and it might be a bonus if it came from South America, to emphasise the central role in that form played by their on-fire Ecuadorian winger Antonio Valencia. And so, from neighbouring Colombia, I offer you <em><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/soundway-records/another-one-bites-the-dust-los\">Otro Muerde El Polvo</a></em> by Los Miticos Del Ritmo, an instrumental cumbia cover of a tub-thumping English rock classic (of sorts). It's not even out yet, that's how on the button I am. Don't thank me.</p><p>If you do happen to like that, try <a href=\"http://grooveshark.com/s/Sinfonia+Agridulce/2GoCD0?src=5\">this</a>, a mariachi cover of a laid-back English indie classic. A couple of years old, but just excellent.</p><p>Anyway, shall we talk football?</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.16pm:</span> So Nani's much-trumpeted comeback from injury takes him only as far as the stands. Javier Hernández, who I thought had quite a poor game against Blackburn on Monday, is replaced by Danny Welbeck, with Ashley Young also coming into the side in polace of Phil Jones. QPR start Jay Bothroyd for the first time since January.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.19pm:</span> Mark Hughes explains that Joey Barton is out of the squad because he's on nine bookings and they don't want him suspended.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.26pm:</span> \"Well they're better choices for songs than the one I thought of when seeing the photo of the managers \u2013 Depeche Mode's Master and Servant,\" writes Gary Naylor, as the teams come out. \"I suspect there'll be a little of that songs S (if not M) meted out today at Old Trafford.\"</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.27pm:</span> \"That is quite a scary photo you have there,\" writes Robin Hazlehurst (picture repeated left, for those who turn up after I've changed the main one). \"Please tell me they weren't facing each other at the time. Although if they were, it is notable that Ferguson is looking unfaithfully over Hughes' left shoulder, possibly eyeing up his next dance partner.\"</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>1 min:</strong> Peeeeeeep! They're off!</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>2 mins:</strong> QPR haven't left their own half, and United have their first kind-of-chance, a free-kick after Clint Hill brought down Welbeck 20-odd yards out. Rooney and Young stand over it.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>3 mins:</strong> Rooney shoots, and the ball hits the head of Anton Ferdinand at the end of the wall and flies wide.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>5 mins:</strong> Another corner from Ashley Young; the keeper comes but gets nowhere near it. It's headed away. \"Do you suppose 1.19pm's Mark Hughes realises that, no matter how long he rests him, Joey Barton will still be on nine bookings next time he plays?\" asks Mac Milling. There's a yellow-card amnesty approaching, I believe.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>6 mins:</strong> And United's barrage continues. If this is QPR's gameplan it's a rubbish one. Another free-kick, another shot from Rooney and this one is on its way in until Paddy Kenny flies across his goal to turn it wide.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>8 mins: </strong>United have had 92% of possession in these first seven minutes. Another key question. \"We all know that footballers aren't allowed to get bevvied and turkied up at Christmas (and people say they have an easy life) but does anyone know if they're still allowed to gobble Easter Eggs today, or if club nutritionists and the like frown on such decadence?\" asks Ryan Dunne. I believe they are allowed an occasional Easter egg, so long as it is poached and not fried or scrambled.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>9 mins: </strong>QPR have just kicked the ball in United's half, several times. It ended with a decent crossing chance for Nedum Onuoha, which he rather fluffed.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>11 mins: </strong>Toph Taylor has had the time to look up what I couldn't, and provides the relevant paragraph of Premier League regulations concerning the yellow card amnesty:</p><blockquote><p><br />(iii) If a Player accumulates ten cautions in FTCM between the opening day of the Playing Season and the second Sunday of April in the same Season, he will be suspended automatically for a period covering:- Two First Team matches</p></blockquote><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>13 mins:</strong> Rooney touches the ball into the path of Welbeck, inside the penalty area, but it was a very pacy touch requiring perfect instant control, which Welbeck didn't quite pull off.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>14 mins: </strong><strong>PENALTY! RED CARD!</strong> Rooney passes the ball into the path of Ashley Young, running into the penalty area. He was two yards offside when the pass was made, and then dived over Shaun Derry's not-that-muscular challenge.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 1 QPR 0 (Rooney, 15 mins)</strong> Rooney shoots low and hard to the goalkeeper's right. Kenny goes the right way, but still can't touch it.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>16 mins: </strong>An abysmal decision by the referee's assistant not to give the offside, and a poor one by the referee to award the penalty, in my opinion.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>19 mins:</strong> Hill fouls Welbeck again \u2013 not much in it, to be fair. Ashley Young shoots into the wall. It's all about the goal difference now, surely. And about the FA charge Mark Hughes will get when he inevitably tells the lino how rubbish his decision was, using a television camera as an intermediary.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>20 mins:</strong> Young's every touch now getting booed by the travelling fans.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>21 mins:</strong> A QPR shot! Taarabt with it, a good 30 yards out, but it strikes Carrick's foot and flies over the bar.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>24 mins: MISS!</strong> Rooney tries to play in Valencia, gives the ball to Taiwo, takes it back again and then crosses to the near post, where Ashley Young meets the ball but heads across goal and wide.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>27 mins: </strong>\"It was offside, but its a penalty and red card instead,\" fumes Kiki, as Rooney's goalbound shot from Valencia's pass is well blocked. \"You gotta be ******* kidding me. **** the premiere league! **** the refs! Every week there's this kinda ********! PS Forward this to FA will ya.\"</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>30 mins: </strong>United are probing gently in search of No2, inevitably focusing their attacks down the right wing. \"Can I just say, as a Red Manc of four decades' standing, that it's decisions like that which give all the ABUs and conspiracy theorists ammunition, isn't it?\" writes Greg Scully. \"Never a pen, and definitely not a red. And it doesn't look like we were gonna need the help, so it just sullies what should be an incredible achievement, in the event that we do lift title #20 this year.\"</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>32 mins: </strong>Taarabt gets into the penalty area, takes the ball round Rafael but then sees his shot blocked by the sliding Evans. Sky replay the penalty incident. It really is a horrific triple-whammy of abysmal decision-making. I think the only fair thing the Premier League can do in the circumstances is to allow Manchester City to start their game at Arsenal with a 1-0 lead.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>36 mins: </strong>Rooney shoots from 22 yards, and the ball was heading towards the top corner, if not at any great pace, before Kenny plucks it out of the air. In the last 10 minutes I've had emails from furious QPR fans, emails from embarrassed United fans, and emails from apoplectic neutrals. Here's the first in defence of the referee: \"The fact is without the offside call from the assistant he had to give the penalty and the red card,\" insists John. \"Derry did put his hand on Young, and even an exagerrated dive cannot save him. Lee Mason won't be happy with his assistant though.\" I think that's a generous interpretation. There may have been contact between the players, but contact alone does not make a foul \u2013 there has to be more than that.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>38 mins: </strong>Valencia crosses from the right, Welbeck at the far post heads over. \"Something must be done about diving,\" rages Malcolm. \"Surely there is a case for video evidence post match. Derry's card should be rescinded and Young banned for four games. The goal should be deducted from the final score and any points adjusted accordingly.\" I'm all in favour of video evidence being used post-match to punish clear cheating, but think that unless there are more camera angles out there this particular incident would, in cricketing parlance, go down as a \"referee's call\".</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>42 mins: </strong>\"Ashley Young is English. And English players get an easier ride compared to the foreign players,\" says Martin Tyler on Fox, according to Ali Kinnaird. I don't think he's wrong: I don't see why Young's reputation should be any better than that of, say, Suárez or before him Di Canio, who both seem to have been swiftly tagged by referees as divers and could scarcely buy a penalty thereafter.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>45 mins: </strong>United have been perfectly capable since that goal, working hard to win possession and working it well around the penalty area, but QPR have been equally industrious in denying them chances. \"That United goal if anything just delegitimises their championship,\" writes Liam Harris. \"They've had abysmal performances in all four other competitions they've been in, and now the 'myth' that they get 'the benefit of the doubt' from refs at Old Trafford emerges again. It's not great when you've got one team trying to buy their way to the title and the other trying to cheat their way, and Chelsea trying to do both but still failing.\"</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>45 mins:</strong> We'll have a single minute of stoppage time here. Scholes celebrates by thwacking a 30-yarder well wide.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>45+1 mins:</strong> Peeeeeep! It's half-time, and QPR fans greet the whistle with a lusty chorus of boos.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>Half-time:</strong> I'm going to draw a line under the penalty incident now. It's happened. We'll hear a lot more about it later, I'm sure. I plan to enjoy the second half as if it never happened. And I don't <em>really</em> think City should be allowed to start their game with a one-goal advantage (though I do think that life would be better if there was a way of reacting to such vital and clearly incorrect decisions that was a little more convincing and meaningful than just shrugging and saying that it evens itself out over a season).</p><p>United have played well, but as is often the case they looked more likely to score in those first 15 minutes, when they were totally dominant, than in the half-hour they played against 10 men. They've had nothing but two headed half-chances since, one from Young at the near post and one from Welbeck at the far, both from Valencia crosses.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>46 mins:</strong> Peeeeeeep! They're off! Again!</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>46 mins:</strong> United immediately on the attack again, and Rooney and Young both have shots blocked within a minute of the restart.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>47 mins:</strong> United have a goal disallowed! Valencia crosses low and hard, and Welbeck is probably a foot offside as he taps it in.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>49 mins:</strong> Ashley Young's lovely backheel plays Welbeck in, but his shot flies over the bar.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>54 mins:</strong> Rooney's low, hard drive from just outside the area is well held by Kenny.</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>56 mins: </strong>Diakité's long-range shot skids wide, helped on its way by a deflection. QPR have had the best of the last couple of minutes. \"My problem with QPR is that you simply can't see them as a plucky underdog,\" writes Michael Hunt. \"They appear to the casual snap-judging football opinion-maker (Hi there!) to be a small club in comparison to their more illustrious opponents this season, and yet the owners and the ludicrous money spent on mediocrity means that they don't get any sympathy. You can't root for them to bring it back, even against United.\" Clearly QPR are the least loveable of the three promoted sides this season, and also, by happy coincidence, the least successful.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>57 mins:</strong> Down the other end, and another shot from distance, this by Scholes, flies wide. Talking of which. \"It seems to me that these days Scholes hardly ever heeds the exhortations of the crowd to SHOOOOOT! from distance,\" writes Ian Childs. \"Efforts from distance seem really rare from Scholes these days, as he almost always to elects to keep the ball moving. Does anyone have any stats on Scholes' long shooting since his return?\"</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>49 mins:</strong> Incredible save! Rafael bursts into the QPR penalty area and is found unmarked and entirely on his own by Scholes's excellent pass. A goal seems inevitable, but the shot clips off the keeper and thuds against the bar.</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>61 mins:</strong> A lovely reverse pass by Rooney finds Welbeck steaming into the penalty area, but his first-time left-foot shot is poor and straight at Kenny, and his follow-up effort, hit while off-balance, is easily caught.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>63 mins:</strong> Ryan Giggs has replaced Ashley Young, and darn nearly gets his head on another Valencia cross in a certain-goalscoring position straight away.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>65 mins: </strong>This from @OptaJoe on Twitter at half-time: \"Michael Carrick (81) &amp; Paul Scholes (76) made 157 passes between them in the first half, 39 more than the whole QPR team.\"</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 2 QPR 0 (Scholes, 68 mins) </strong>Bad news for Ian Childs' credibility, as Scholes takes yet another shot from range. Teed up by Rafael, he sends the ball arrowing into the bottom left corner of the goal, from about 25 yards. No doubt about that one.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>71 mins: </strong>QPR substitutions: Tommy Smith and Shaun Wright-Phillips replace Adel Taarabt, who gifted United possession in the run-up to the second goal, and Samba Diakité.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>73 mins:</strong> United replace Scholes with Tom Cleverley, and bring Phil Jones on for Rafael, who had just been booked, apparently for falling over.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>77 mins: </strong>WOWEE! A patient United attack ends with Evra passing the ball inside to Carrick, whose shot from a good 40 yards thuds into the post. \"Given Ian Childs' delicious tempting of fate re: Scholes' long-range shooting, is there any chance he could write an email along the lines of 'Can anyone remember the last time Arsenal scored 14 goals in a game?'\" asks Greg Scully.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>80 mins: </strong>Another substitution: QPR bring DJ Campbell on for England's Jay Bothroyd.</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>83 mins: </strong>QPR chief executive Phil Beard on Twitter: \"Difficult to take after watching numerous replays but Ashley Young could partner Tom Daley at the Olympics. #QPR\"</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>85 mins:</strong> Not much by way of tempo in this game now. United are controlling possession, the game is won, and QPR have their minds on Wednesday's match against Swansea. Cleverley has a shot deflected wide.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>88 mins: </strong>The teams from the Emirates, for those who are interested: <strong>Arsenal: </strong>Szczesny, Sagna, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Arteta, Song, Walcott, Rosicky, Benayoun, van Persie. Subs: Fabianski, Andre Santos, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ramsey, Djourou, Jenkinson, Chamakh. <strong>Man City: </strong>Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Lescott, Clichy, Touré Yaya, Barry, Milner, Aguero, Nasri, Balotelli. Subs: Pantilimon, Richards, Pizarro, Dzeko, Kolarov, Tevez, De Jong. <strong>Referee:</strong> Martin Atkinson.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>90 mins:</strong> We'll have three minutes of stoppage time.</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>90+2 mins:</strong> United keep possession for long enough for me to start writing that they'll play out the rest of the match in their own half, and then sweep forward. Cleverley curls a shot wide from the edge of the area.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>90+3 mins:</strong> Peeeeeeep! It's all over. United open up an eight-point lead over Manchester City, for a couple of hours at the very least.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>Final thoughts: </strong>United were always likely to win this. Not just in prospect: they utterly dominated the opening exchanges. In all likelihood it made little difference to this match that the breakthrough came from a penalty that shouldn't have been given, involving a player who was offside, resulting in an extremely harsh red card. Had united thereafter swept 10-man QPR aside with a scintilating display of attacking greatness, it could almost have been forgotten. But that didn't happen, and it won't be. Lee Mason should be on the receiving end of a helluva rollicking at some point shortly, and his assistant will presumably be manning League Two touchlines with that bloke from Chelsea v Wigan for the remainder of the season.</p><p>Over, then, to Manchester City.

        "headline":"If only Holyrood appreciated woman",
        "body":"<p>Attempting to plot the exact time when the decline and fall of the Labour party in Scotland began is a difficult exercise. There are some who believe the party signed its own execution warrant simply by its enthusiasm for the devolution project. Donald Dewar's subsequent unholy inquisition in which he ensured that only the \"right sort\" would be deemed worthy of selection for the first diet of Holyrood has similarly had disastrous consequences for Labour. It meant that when the party ceded power to the SNP in 2007 there were depressingly few politicians of sufficient calibre to challenge what was a formidable array of talent and experience on the nationalist side.</p><p>Alex Salmond and his inner sanctum of acolytes and devotees has proved to be comfortable in possession. The principle members of his cabinet have survived more or less intact after five years of power. In the decade before they took Holyrood, there were few occasions when Sturgeon, Swinney, MacAskill, Hyslop and even the maverick Russell were not acting in concert and refining their plan of action for the first 100 days of eventual SNP government. Yet on those fleeting occasions when they have dropped the ball, Labour has also been found wanting in pressing home the advantage. Their utter defenestration and humiliation in 2011 at the hands of a hardened and efficient government machine was inevitable.</p><p>On the day Iain Gray finally demitted office and Salmond patronised him and ruffled his hair he must then have appreciated how a Motherwell manager feels when an Old Firm boss approaches him at the end of another wretched cup final. For Labour supporters, it doesn't get much worse than this. And when Johann Lamont, the Labour member for Glasgow Pollok, was elected to succeed Gray it seemed that, for Scottish Labour, the party was finally over.</p><p>Lamont is a woman for whom commentators will reach for words such as \"redoubtable\", \"formidable\" or \"busy\". What they really mean is that they would normally expect to encounter someone like her foraging for comestibles in Tesco. That she represents one of Glasgow's edgier arrondissements completes the picture. Yet that is partly where her strength lies. There was a time, before Blair, Mandelson and Miliband hijacked the party, when a person such as Johann Lamont would have epitomised all that Labour represented: hard work, honesty, aspiration, integrity and compassion. She is Labour incarnate and her slogan might simply be: \"No nonsense\".</p><p>Even so, it was feared that, for all these qualities, she would simply be swept aside in debate with Alex Salmond. For the last 10 years or so, he has forsaken breakfast most Thursday mornings in the knowledge that he will have a Labour leader, seasoned and garnished, before the day is out. Ms Lamont, though, has risen to the challenge of facing him. She has rarely been bested at first minister's questions and has taken care in choosing the ground on which to engage her party's nemesis. She comes well prepared and does not lose her equanimity when the first minister's mouth assumes its default aspect which is halfway between a smirk and a snort.</p><p>Even in her bad moments, she retains her composure and emerges with dignity. One of these occurred two weeks ago in an exchange about education. The SNP's sorcery when it quotes numbers in any discussion about learning is well known. If you listen for long enough to Mike Russell, the education minister, you may form the impression that every pupil in Scotland will become a doctor of philosophy by the time the nationalists have done with them. Lamont had talked about a nursery nurse for every child when she ought actually to have said that each child should have access to one. Salmond pounced in characteristic style, but in so doing merely sounded like a supercilious and hectoring bully. Ms Lamont is underneath his skin.</p><p>The new Labour leader's nerveless performances in the chamber have illuminated a curious phenomenon in Scottish Labour since 1999 and one that should make the party pause for reflection. With the exception of Jack McConnell and, to a lesser extent, Henry McLeish, Labour's real stars at Holyrood have all been women. Susan Deacon's performance at health in the first Holyrood Labour administration has never since been bettered, though Nicola Sturgeon is currently giving her a run for her money. McConnell, though, banished Deacon to the back-benches in reprisal for her failing to back him in the contest that gave him the leadership. Wendy Alexander, like Deacon, is also possessed of a fierce and acute intellect yet chose to resign as Labour leader for a minor fiscal infraction of which she'd had no knowledge. Holyrood is diminished by the continuing absence of these two.</p><p>And you have to wonder why Margaret Curran and Cathy Jamieson are ossifying within the most under-worked and irrelevant political grouping anywhere in the UK: the Scottish Labour group at Westminster. If these four had been occupying the senior frontbench places that their talents and experience deserved, then Scottish Labour would not currently be staring into the abyss. A lack of vision and an absence of strategic leadership meant that their rightful places are currently being filled by the eager and the busy, but sadly also the woebegotten.</p><p>What is it in the psyche of a substantial number of Scottish men that makes them fear and loathe women with brains? Joan McAlpine, the first minister's parliamentary liaison officer, will climb high within the SNP, but she is already finding out that being a woman with an intellect brings you grief both within and without your party. And if you think Nicola Sturgeon has escaped this then just wait until she tries to succeed Salmond as leader of the SNP.</p><p>For the moment, Johann Lamont need not concern herself with this. She is the unopposed mistress of Labour's destiny. And in her bustling and no-nonsense form, the old parties of the United Kingdom may just have found an unlikely champion as they fight to preserve the Union.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Scottish+National+party+%28SNP%29&k=Alex+Salmond&k=Scotland&k=Politics&k=UK+news&k=Labour\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=If+only+Holyrood+appreciated+woman+%7C+Kevin+McKenna+Article+1728412&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=148491&c4=SNP+%28Politics%29%2CAlex+Salmond%2CScotland+%28News%29%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CLabour&c3=The+Observer&c6=Kevin+McKenna&c7=12-Apr-07&c8=1728412&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/2012/apr/08/alex-salmond-holyrood-johann-lamont|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|f72bc9e7e2e4d339427f2907419aee921ee54869 -->",

        "headline":"The pleasures of rereading",
        "body":"<p>It usually starts with a pretence of steeliness. Not the whole thing, I'll tell myself, reaching for the ruined paperback. One chapter, a favourite passage, then I'll wedge it back in with those books begun but not yet finished; the dozens more bought or inherited that I honestly mean to open, sooner to get to all of Dickens. I'm a chronic rereader, mostly of novels, and it is a habit as coiled with guilt as it  is with pleasure, because every go-round with  a favourite is also another time I haven't read <em>Bleak House</em>.</p><p>The trouble is that a chapter or passage is never enough. The same qualities that seduced once seduce again. I've had watertight plans to parachute in at one of <em>Brideshead Revisited</em>'s irresistible mealtime scenes, read, and get out again; plans ruined by the compulsion to flick back a page, back a chapter \u2013 gah \u2013 back to the prologue. <em>The Go-Between</em> is my private demon. An innocent reminder, I'll think, how LP Hartley phrased his famous opening line\u2026 suddenly it's midnight and I'm 100 pages deep and Ted is oiling his shotgun.</p><p>The affliction struck early. For me, as for many kids of the 80s, novels were pitiful things if not written by Roald Dahl, and aged 10 or so I met the unusual dilemma of exhausting an author's catalogue. With <em>Matilda</em>, <em>The Witches</em> and the rest devoured, only Dahl's intimidating stream of adult stories and the latterly published <em>Esio Trot </em>were left. I thumbed through <em>Trot</em>, dismayed that it didn't have any obvious chocolate factories or marvellous medicines, instead a couple of moony pensioners and a tortoise. I supposed I could try it. Or (the option seemed amazing, possibly illegal) why not restart one of my favourites?</p><p>I haven't gone back to <em>Esio Trot</em> yet, and every reread since that first shaky reach for <em>Matilda</em> has been tinged with the same concern: that to refuse the new is to break some elemental code of literature. That to reread is lazy, maybe even impolite. So I've faked anticipation when somebody spots the paperback I'm carrying and says that I'll love Cecil when he appears in <em>A Room With a View</em> or that <em>Any Human Heart</em> gets very, very sad. I've thought about folding the dust-jacket of a pristine Mrs Gaskell around a battered Martin Amis, just to avoid a friend or relative asking: \"Again?\"</p><p>Examples mentioned here are personal. The novels that yoke the rereader are not universal \u2013 they're not always good. Some of the motivations and satisfactions, though, must be shared.</p><p>It is time travel, a reliable way to reawaken feelings sparked by a book at first encounter. George MacDonald Fraser's series of Flashman novels summons for me an early stretch at university, when I picked up one in a stranger's room, skimmed a paragraph, and realised with excitement and dread that my set-text reading plan would now implode. <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> brings back a thrilling first sense of professional life and the daily commute, Orwell's novel finished while travelling across town for work experience at 15. Salinger's slim book of stories will forever be a ski-trip coach that smelled not unpleasantly of Chewits; <em>Laughter in the Dark</em> a summer spent dumped and misanthropic and grateful for Nabokov's mean wit. <em>Howard's End</em> is the time I met my wife, opened every year since.</p><p>Security is a factor. Max Beerbohm's <em>Zuleika Dobson</em> was funny when last picked up and can fairly be expected to have stayed that way on the shelf. No need to gamble on new characters or a new set of circumstances \u2013 abstentions that for some would void the chief appeal of fiction are for the rereader a lure, because that massive investment of hours can be made without risk of disappointment. The last page of Steinbeck's brick-sized <em>East of Eden</em> will unfailingly thrill me. I sweat through Tom Ripley's police interviews every time.</p><p>Actually, those nervy near-arrests in <em>The Talented Mr Ripley</em> are a bit of an exception. Suspense is the first thing to die on a reread, and the experience is better for it. Familiar with the story, the plot on rails, the rereader can relax, look around and whistle at the scenery. I first read Marilynne Robinson's <em>Gilead</em> racked by an irrational fear that the old and ill narrator was going to croak on every next page. Only during a second and third read could I properly absorb Robinson's gentle wisdom.</p><p>Even when it gets silly (a fourth reread, a fifth, pages tugged loose and the book plump with place-holding Travelcards), old favourites can surprise. On a sixth or seventh lap of <em>The Go-Between</em>, I finally paid proper heed to Marcus Maudsley, that fantastic little shit of an 11-year-old who has all the polished procedural snobbery of a Victorian ancient. A bit-player once ignored, now treasured.</p><p>I wonder if Hartley intended Marcus to be a slow burner. Some novelists definitely anticipate the rereader and lay rewards. Nabokov slaps an outrageous spoiler on page two of <em>Lolita</em>, detectable only if you've finished it before. At the beginning of the first Harry Potter book (guilty), there's throwaway mention of a character who won't appear for two more sequels. The novelists might be rereaders themselves, this their show of fellowship. Or perhaps it's authorial swagger \u2013 confident assertion that, yeah, this is one of <em>those</em> books. The sort the rereader thwaps shut with a grunt, already reaching for Scotch Tape to strengthen the spine, smugly pondering the £7.99 investment that'll pay back again in two years, in four\u2026</p><p>To freshen my memory before writing this, I carefully explored my book shelves, alert for scuffed bindings, squeezing paperbacks for the tell-tale crackle of sand and crisp-crumb. They weren't all there, my stalwarts, but I found them \u2013 some in a pile by the sofa, a few kicked under the bed, one hidden away in an old shoulder-bag. I'd seized them up when last ill or bored or moody or restless, in need of comfort.</p><p>Rereading is therapy, despite the accompanying dash of guilt, and I find it strange that not everybody does it. Why wouldn't you go back to something good? I return to these novels for the same reason I return to beer, or blankets or best friends.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/books&k=Fiction&k=Books&k=Culture&k=Best+books&k=Roald+Dahl&k=Vladimir+Nabokov\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/books/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/books/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=The+pleasures+of+rereading+Article+1727537&ch=Books&c2=148491&c4=Fiction+%28Books+genre%29%2CBooks%2CCulture%2CBest+books%2CRoald+Dahl%2CVladimir+Nabokov+%28Author%29%2CEM+Forster+%28Author%29&c3=The+Observer&c6=Tom+Lamont&c7=12-Apr-07&c8=1727537&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: books/2012/apr/08/rereading-favourite-books-pleasure|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|ab3be32a9bb422a1756547966e17f75f75c78544 -->",

This fifth album is arguably his most measured, setting his supple vocals to acoustic, subtly innovative arrangements. Dark-hued ballads take prominence and allow his flair for the tender and dramatic to shine. \"The Captain's Apprentice\" has a maritime, Brittanesque atmosphere, ghostly clanks attend \"The 18th of June\", while the stately \"Lord Douglas\" comes with accordion and pedal steel. By contrast, Anaïs Mitchell's \"If It's True\" gets a theatrical, orchestral treatment and a banjo-flaying version of Fleetwood Mac's \"Big Love\" is a surprising winner.

        "headline":"James Haskell scours globe to enrich his game en route back to Wasps",
        "body":"<p>If you should ever fancy an airgun pellet between the shoulder blades, you could do worse than cavort through the backcountry around Dunedin shouting, \"Woo-hoo, The Hask!\" The chances are you will tweak the nerves of James Haskell, who will almost certainly be out hunting somewhere nearby, armed with said weapon and urged on by Andrew Hore and his other new team-mates at the Highlanders.</p><p>\"Please don't refer to me as The Hask,\" he says politely, but with a clear undertone. Then he complains they all call him that in Dunedin, the latest city he calls home, before launching into an explanation of the provenance of a nickname he considers a travesty. It's something to do with a perception that he promotes himself as a brand.</p><p>It is true that he has his own website and is an avid user of social media, but for all his love of gadgets and techno-geekery there is something very old-fashioned about him as well. For a start, there's his proclivity for lying low in the wilderness of the South Island alongside grizzled All Black front-row forwards.</p><p>\"Andrew Hore is a big one for shooting,\" says Haskell. \"He describes it as doing a few jobs, so he'll come up to me and say, 'I've got a few jobs on. You interested?' Last time it was some rabbit shooting, a bit of pest clearance on the farm of a friend of his, with him and Jamie MacKintosh [the Highlanders captain and a prop forward capped by the All Blacks].\"</p><p>And then there's the fact that Haskell is to be found on the other side of the world at all, when every other English back-row forward of his calibre and generation is to be found up here, fighting for a place in the national team.</p><p>Haskell is ambitious, but not to the exclusion of everything else. His stint with the Highlanders in the Super 15 is the last leg of a three-year odyssey that has also taken him to Paris and Tokyo, before he returns to Wasps next season, the club where it all started. Never let it be said that he is shy of the more glamorous aspects of his profession, but this journey smacks more of a passion to see the world and to live life.</p><p>\"It takes a lot of sacrifices to come over here. You're leaving your friends and family to go to a place where you don't know anyone. Financially, over here it's a&nbsp;very different ball game. The money just isn't competitive, so you have to make it a purely rugby decision. And you've got to give up your England place. So I don't think this will become a common move.\"</p><p>Ah, his England place. It might have been forgotten \u2013 amid all the recent excitement over England's ascension from \"the gutter\", as Graham Rowntree put it \u2013 that their growing stock of options in the back row will soon be supplemented further by the return of Haskell. England's descent into the depths was so vertiginous and so quickly reversed that it is tempting to ask whether it ever really happened. As someone who has seen England from the inside and out in recent times, Haskell's a good person to ask.</p><p>\"It is up to Wig [Rowntree], his choice of words, but it was a difficult period of time. People made mistakes. But the problem with anything in life is that if you just focus on the media, without any inside knowledge of what went on, you naturally have a biased opinion. Everyone wanted an England team to be proud of [at the World Cup] and they were disappointed. If you took everything that was written at face value \u2014 that the guys were on a stag do and so on \u2014 then it helped to compound the problems and put English rugby into a dark place. But with the new coaches it's on the way up again and back to where it should be. Guys are focused on performance and the talk is about the rugby, and nothing else.\"</p><p>Haskell did not get to watch much of the Six Nations and what he did see was in highlights packages. Kick-off times in the northern hemisphere make it very difficult for those in New Zealand to follow rugby up here and this is reflected in their indifference towards it. There is an amusing video on the internet in which Haskell asks some of his Highlanders team-mates their opinions of northern-hemisphere rugby. The more mischievous (Hore, for example) use it as a chance to indulge in banter about how boring it is, but all of them confess to not knowing because they never watch any of it. This is one&nbsp;of several cultural differences Haskell has had to embrace during his recent adventures.</p><p>\"It's interesting. You ask people in England what they think of Super 15, they'll have a lot more comments than the other way round. That's what I've always found with Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. They just focus on what they're doing, whereas in the UK we look outwards more. Talking to the guys who are All Blacks, when they're preparing for an international they do some analysis on patterns of play, but they don't focus on the minutiae of their opponents. Some players might disagree, but I reckon if you asked an All Black after a game who his opposite number was, most of the time he wouldn't know, unless it was someone like Jonny Wilkinson.\"</p><p>After the World Cup, Haskell went to Japan to play alongside Ma'a Nonu and Tamati Ellison for Ricoh Black Rams for a few months. He describes Japanese rugby as the fastest he has ever played. The players are so well drilled that skill levels are higher than in the Top 14 in France, where you might see 10 or 15 balls go down in a Stade Français training session. But the French are infused with their natural flair and a ferocious devotion to physicality. Their emotions fluctuate wildly. Japanese emotions can run high too, but they are tempered by the attention to drills. In New Zealand, the approach is more recognisable to an Anglo-Saxon one, but they are blessed with a culture that promotes touch rugby from a young age, with less focus on weights and conditioning.</p><p>After such an experience, Haskell will surely return to England a better player than he was when he left on a two-year deal with Stade Français in 2009, and it is to his credit that he has seen fit to embark on such an adventure. It was noticeable how improved his form for England was in the 2011 Six Nations, courtesy of his French sojourn, and Wasps (in particular) and England will wait with interest to see how he returns from his subsequent stints in Japan and New Zealand.</p><p>\"I wanted to play Super 15. I wanted to develop some maturity, some leadership and to work on my skill set. Also I want to have played all round the world. Then you can come to informed opinions. People make very many comments in life when they don't have the background or the knowledge. I'll be able to tell you what it's like in four of the big leagues in the rugby world. I've had a great experience. I've played with some of the best players in the world, and I've loved every minute of it.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=England+rugby+union+team&k=New+Zealand+rugby+union+team&k=Stade+Fran%C3%A7ais&k=Rugby+union&k=Sport\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=James+Haskell+scours+globe+to+enrich+his+game+en+route+back+to+Wasps+%7C+Michael+Aylwin+Article+1728430&ch=Sport&c2=148491&c4=England+rugby+union+team%2CNew+Zealand+rugby+union+team%2CStade+Francais+%28Rugby+union%29%2CRugby+union%2CSport&c3=The+Observer&c6=Michael+Aylwin&c7=12-Apr-07&c8=1728430&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/2012/apr/07/james-haskell-england-new-zealand-rugby|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|35d867370756fbbe377ffbc02e554a2449fbd625 -->",

England could be hope-shreddingly inept at everything else if they liked but, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;innings_number=4;orderby=start;qualmax1=149;qualval1=target;result=2;spanmin2=15+Mar+1977;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;type=team;view=innings\">unlike those mentally weak Aussies</a>, they knew how to knock off small totals. Between 1903 and 2011, England had a target of between 100 and 149 to win a Test on 26 occasions. Their record was almost perfect: W23 D2 L1. Twice they ran out of time; once, famously, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63203.html\">they were Hadleed in Christchurch</a>.</p><p>Then Abu Dhabi happened. England did not just fail to reach a target of 145 against Pakistan in January; they failed to make half of it. They are likely to have another tricky little chase against Sri Lanka today; if so, they will have to cope with the Sri Lanka spin attack of Herath, Randiv and Demons. </p><p>Sri Lanka will resume on 218 for six, a lead of 33. That score is slightly deceptive, however, because England's six wickets include two nightwatchmen. They still need to dismiss at least two of Angelo Mathews, Prasanna Jayawardene and Mahela Jayawardene, although they do have a newish ball to work with. You might as well set up camp behind the sofa. This could well be what Ashley Giles used to describe as an \"arse-nipper\".</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>A quick recap of what this match means in terms of the ICC rankings</strong></p><p>\u2022 If England win, they stay No1 in the world</p><p>\u2022 If they draw, they drop below South Africa </p><p>\u2022 If they lose, they drop below South Africa and could be overtaken by Australia by the end of the month</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>5.15am GMT / 12.15am ET</strong> \"I see you've got a big piece in the Times today,\" says Alex Davies. \"Playing away are we?\" </p><p>Oh, that's taken from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wisden-Cricketers-Almanack-Lawrence-Booth/dp/1408156342/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333771671&amp;sr=8-1\">Lawrence Booth's Wisden Almanack</a>, which is available in all good bookshops from Wednesday.

He pushed a nasty delivery from Swann towards short leg, where Cook put down a sharp chance down by his left ankle. \"I'm on Moreton Island,\" says Charlie Clover, who already has one up on me, \"surrounded by genteel tattooed Queensland women and fat kids. Paradise. However I can't help but wonder if I'll be covered with XXXX (washed down with a knuckle sanga) if I go to the resort bar to ask them to turn off the NRL, and put on the England cricket. Thoughts?\" Do what needs to be done. Or, better still, get somebody else to do it for you.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>93rd over: Sri Lanka 221-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 3)</strong> It'll be the marvellous Jimmy Anderson at the other end. Can he produce one last new-ball burst to complete a brilliant personal winter? It's a good first over, in which Jayawardene touches two to fine leg. \"I'm here Rob, following the OBO in a dark hotel room in Siem Reap, Cambodia when I should be out looking at ancient temples or at least drinking local beer,\" says Joe Minihane.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>94th over: Sri Lanka 222-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 4)</strong> Jayawardene pads up to a big off break from Swann, bringing the inevitable LBW appeal, but there was far too much doubt for Bruce Oxenford to give that. Swann has started well; so has Jayawardene, whose defence looks airtight. \"I'm up and ready and have the fingernails ready,\" says Mona Stead. \"A lovely 20 degress in Melbourne.\"</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>REVIEW! Sri Lanka 223-6 (Jayawardene not out 58)</strong> Jayawardene has been given out LBW! Asad Rauf took an <em>age</em> to give it. It was a magnificently theatrical appeal from Anderson, who was beseeching Asad Rauf to raise the finger. I thought Jayawardene was just outside the line, but it was very close. There might have been an inside edge as well. In fact, he definitely inside-edged it. The front-on replays aren't clear but you can see it from the camera behind the batsman. This will be overturned by Rod Tucker. Yes, <strong>Jayawardene survives</strong>, and both sides have one review remaining.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>95th over: Sri Lanka 223-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 5)</strong> Sri Lanka's lead is <strong>38</strong>. \"Ah Larry Booth,\" says Oliver Pattenden. \"Or 'Mr. Booth' as my ex-girlfriend from university used to call him. I'd be up writing a paper, OBO in the background, emailing in various quips or opinions, and she'd joke 'cheating on me with Mr. Booth again?'. And in the years after we graduated, I'd be occupied with a match, eschewing one of her family events. And, more sternly this time, she'd ask 'what do I say to my parents? You're busy with Mr. Booth?'. Of course time moved on. Booth left the Guardian. She and I broke up. Booth wrote for different papers. She and I dated new people. She no longer returns my emails. You never post mine. I guess that's the nature of change. There's no harm in nostalgia and regret, but that doesn't mean it doesn't still hurt.\"</p><p>That's beautifully sad. Sort of. It's like the bit in (500) Days of Summer where he makes the same joke at two different points in time, only the second time is when the relationship is crumbling, and she doesn't laugh. The breakdown of a relationship through the prism of Lawrence Booth. Who'd have thought?</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>96th over: Sri Lanka 224-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 6)</strong> Jayawardene is beaten by a gorgeous delivery from Swann that skids straight on. Swann is bowling superbly here.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>97th over: Sri Lanka 225-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 7)</strong> Mathews edges Anderson a fraction short of Swann at second slip. This has been a seriously purposeful start from England. They know how vital it is to take wickets while the ball is fairly new. Anderson is trying to unsettle Mathews with a few verbals.</p><p>\"Having just got back from Canada yesterday lunchtime I am now suffering from a severe bout of jet lag,\" says Ian Mell. \"This means I've been up most of the night working and I'm not sure I can cope with England chasing a sub -200 total today. If we all ask nicely do you think England can do the honourable thing and skittle Sri Lanka in the next half hour so that we may be able to chase 100 before lunchtime?\" Comfortable wins are for wimps. Make mine an arse-nipper.*<br /><em><br />* Guardian man reserves the right to amend this entry later in the day if England are 90 for eight chasing 101.</em></p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>98th over: Sri Lanka 227-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 59, Mathews 8)</strong> Mathews feels nervously at Swann, inside-edging onto the pad and not far wide of Cook at short leg. \"I am out here, Rob,\" says Ian Copestake, \"and I just want to say that I love you.\" No, Copestake, it's I just <em>called</em> to say I love you. You've ruined a potentially perfect moment with inadequate knowledge of Stevie Wonder song titles.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>99th over: Sri Lanka 232-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 60, Mathews 12)</strong> Mathews pulls Anderson superbly for  the first boundary of the day \u2013 and the first since the 77th over in fact. That's Anderson's fourth over of the morning. He probably has one more at most.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>100th over: Sri Lanka 233-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 61, Mathews 12)</strong> Mathews is dropped again by Cook at short leg! This was another sharp chance, low to his right when Mathews pushed at another good delivery from Swann. They are not easy in that position, although I reckon Ian Bell would have taken at least one of them. Swann is bowling a beautiful spell and beats Mathews on the outside two balls later. In other news, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/StuartBroad8/status/188365872623132672\">Stuart Broad is single</a>. An orderly one please, ladies, an orderly one.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>101st over: Sri Lanka 236-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 62, Mathews 14)</strong> Tim Bresnan replaces Jimmy Anderson at the Janashakthi End. Three from the over, so Sri Lanka's lead is now 51. \"On a more prosaic note,\" begins Ian Copestake, \"I do think Oliver Pattenden has grounds for suing Booth for loss of booty.\"</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 238-7 (M Jayawardene c Cook b Swann 64)</strong> Graeme Swann has got Mahela Jayawardene with a beauty! That should be a matchwinning breakthrough. It was a horrible delivery that turned and bounced to hit the glove before deflecting onto the body and up in the air.  Cook, diving forward from short leg, took a comfortable catch. That was close to unplayable. It's the end of an immaculate defensive innings from Jayawardene \u2013 64 from 191 balls with four fours \u2013 and Swann has yet another five-wicket haul.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>102nd over: Sri Lanka 238-7 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 14, P Jayawardene 0)</strong> \"Morning Smyth, morning everybody,\" says Josh Robinson. \"I'm here (for values of here that include Berlin). And have just about recovered from jet-lag. I've discovered that even if you can't get to sleep until 4 or 5, getting up to follow the Test is a good enough way of ensuring that after a few days you'll be so exhausted that you collapse in bed at about 9.30pm (much to the chagrin of your partner) and are back on a more or less normal rhythm shortly afterwards. More or less normal means that I'm sending relatively inane emails to you, of course. Flight back to Stansted tonight, and then Sawyer's joining me for a trip to Fenner's to watch the last day of the Lancashire game tomorrow. I suppose there are worse ways to spend the Easter weekend.\" Diane Sawyer?</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>103rd over: Sri Lanka 240-7 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 16, P Jayawardene 0)</strong> \"I have an engineering entrance exam tomorrow but here I am sitting on my table constantly refreshing the OBO page instead of umm, lets say, solving Simple Harmonic motion problems,\" says Utkarsh Sharma. \"But I will tell you one thing, there is absolutely no need of chirping in a sentence like 'Anyone out there' in the updates. It makes me feel guilty of being the only one wasting time this way.\"</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 242-8 (P Jayawardene b Swann 2)</strong> Got him! Swann has picked up two Jayawardenes in as many overs. Prasanna Jayawardene had almost fallen twice earlier in the over when he missed a sweep shot and was bowled behind his legs. That's a dreadful stroke. Swann has six for 92; he should really end up with an eight-for here. He also has ten in the match for the second time in his Test career.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>104th over: Sri Lanka 242-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 16, Herath 0)</strong> England are into the tail now, with just Herath and Lakmal to come. Mathews should probably go into one-day mode and try to smack Sri Lanka towards a three-figure lead. Herath is beaten a beauty first ball.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>105th over: Sri Lanka 247-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 21, Herath 0)</strong> Mathews does go into one-day mode, slugging Bresnan to long on for four. He is an extremely dangerous hitter. \"Please can you politely tell all the people in hot sunny places to [rude word] off?\" says Robin Hazlehurst. \"It wasn't funny when an inch of snow fell last weekend, it was even less funny to get up this morning and find two more inches had fallen. The Estonian cricket season is unlikely to be starting at Easter this year. In other news, those who don't want an arse-nipper could consider that if Sri Lanka bat until teatime it probably won't be a close finish.\"</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>106th over: Sri Lanka 248-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 22, Herath 0)</strong> Mathews is still taking singles when they are on offer, as he does in that over when he reverse sweeps Swann straight onto the shin of Anderson at slip. Had Anderson stood still he might have taken the catch, but he had moved to his right once he saw Mathews shaping to reverse sweep.</p><p>\"I'm currently in Manhattan, New York, following the OBO,\" says Zubair Shah. \"By coincidence I'm staying at my cousin's house, Zul Jamal, who is one of the investors in <a href=\"http://deathofagentlemanfilm.com/\">Death of a Gentleman</a>. I'm trying to find a single channel out of the 1024 on his TV that is showing the game. I've found a duck race, a 'how to loosen your bowels' infomercial and a 'god bless good hygiene' feature. Alas no Test match. You continue to be my only saviour.\" A saviour? Little ol' me?</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>107th over: Sri Lanka 250-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 23, Herath 1)</strong> Tim Bresnan is replaced by Samit Patel. This is a decent move, as Mathews might find it harder to go after spin than seam. He drives a single to long on, and Herath mows another single into the leg side. Sri Lanka lead by <strong>65</strong>.</p><p>\"Hi there from Friday night in Quito,\" says Steve Bennett. \"Have just been to a 'British pub' (the Turtle's Head, hardy ha) which was showing nothing but rally and baseball, and serving a selection of British lagers including Heinekin and Miller draft. Forget finding a place to watch the cricket, does anyone know a place in Quito which sells decent beer? I'm in an Aussie-run backpacker hostel. An England win would go down nicely with breakfast tomorrow, thanks.\" I'll see what I can do.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>108th over: Sri Lanka 251-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 23, Herath 2)</strong> Herath is beaten by a jaffa from Swann. That was far too good for a No10. One from the over. \"I'm out here,\" says Mac Millings, \"if by 'here' you mean 'following England clumsily hide inevitable defeat behind the illusion of likely victory'. Also, I think the 102nd over's Josh Robinson is referring to Sawyer out of 'Lost' \u2013 a man so grubbily handsome that, just when it all finally seemed so clear, you'll question your orientation all over again. Either him or OBO regular Phil Sawyer, a man so grubbily etc and so forth.\"</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 251-9 (Herath c Anderson b Patel 2)</strong> Herath was never going to last long. He propped forward to a delivery from Patel that didn't turn as much as he expected and edged it straight to Anderson at slip.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>REVIEW! Sri Lanka 251-9 (Lakmal not out 0)</strong> England have used their last review. Lakmal got his bat jammed against his boot as he tried to play a very full delivery from Patel. The ball hit him on the toe and then looped up into the hands of Matt Prior. I don't think there was any bat involved; even if there was, the evidence is nowhere near conclusive enough. So Lakmal survives. Still, it was worth a try with only one wicket remaining. It maintains England's 100 per cent DRS record in this series: 10 reviews, none successful.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>109th over: Sri Lanka 251-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 23, Lakmal 0)</strong> Mathews must surely farm the strike now. \"My girlfriend, Shelagh, is preparing to open her new cafe in Shoreditch on Tuesday,\" says Mat Neale. \"Thanks to her I've been awake for the start of play for the last couple of days, so that's worth a shameless plug I feel.\" Sure, why not. <a href=\"http://www.salvationjanecafe.co.uk/\">Who fancies a little bit of Australia in Shoreditch</a>?</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>110th over: Sri Lanka 252-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 24, Lakmal 0)</strong> Mathews declines a single from Swann's third delivery and then heaves a single to long on from the fifth.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>111th over: Sri Lanka 260-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 32, Lakmal 0)</strong> Mathews laps Patel for four and then crashes the last ball of the over through point for four. Sri Lanka lead by 75, but Swann now should have a full over at Lakmal. \"Do you also reserve the right to change the time?\" says John Starbuck. \"You should, as we are now in BST: GMT was overtaken some time ago but in your content early-rising condition you probably didn't notice.\"</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>112th over: Sri Lanka 264-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 32, Lakmal 4)</strong> Lakmal inside edges Swann just short of Cook at short leg and then drives him through extra cover for four!</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>113th over: Sri Lanka 265-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 33, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews keeps the strike with a single off the last ball of Patel's over. \"Adding to the weight of local non-exotic localizations, I'm up with my 18-month old daughter in a chilly Dorset, placating her with endless cheery technicolor productions on CBeebies that should really be barred from this unearthly hour and toasted fruit bread,\" says Richard Rowe. \"In return she's just about allowing me to follow the Test on the OBO. Any thoughts of sneakily switching on TMS are met with squealing demands to get 3rd And Bird back on the tellybox.\"</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>114th over: Sri Lanka 270-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 38, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews reverse sweeps Swann to third man for four and then takes a single from the fourth delivery. Lakmal survives the rest of the over.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>115th over: Sri Lanka 271-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Mathews 39, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews drives Patel's last ball for a single, and on we go with this mildly irritating last-wicket stand. Sri Lanka lead by 86. \"Following OBO in Nairobi instead of getting dressed to go a cousin's wedding,\" says Daudi Were. \"Would any of your readers know if we're meant to wear trousers under a Ugandan kanzu? The wife wants us in Ugandan high fashion today.\"</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>116th over: Sri Lanka 272-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Mathews 40, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews take a single from Swann's fourth ball, and Lakmal does the necessary. He has looked comfortable, actually, for somebody who is supposed to be a rank tailender.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>117th over: Sri Lanka 277-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Mathews 45, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews blasts Patel for four and then, again, keeps the strike with a single off the last ball. \"Daudi Were?\" says Mike Selvey of the email in the 115th over. \"Is that the fellow who used to soar in the lineout for Scotland, and much loved of Bill McLaren?\"</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>118th over: Sri Lanka 278-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Mathews 46, Lakmal 4)</strong> See 116th over.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 278 all out (Mathews c Strauss b Finn 46)</strong> A good bowling change from Andrew Strauss ends a pesky last-wicket partnership. Mathews had become a bit too comfortable so Strauss went for a change of pace, bringing on Steven Finn for Samit Patel. Mathews, undone by a bit of uneven bounce, looped a short ball to Strauss, who took a good catch running back from midwicket. That's the end of the morning session, and it's been a job well done by England. After lunch they will need <strong>94</strong> to square the series and stay top of the ICC rankings. It should be a comfortable victory. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSRN8O4ULQs#t=10m27s\">Should</a>.</p><p>\"Suggest Daudi Were goes commando to the wedding,\" phwoars Robyn Adams. \"Should enliven the maiden aunts and possibly the bridesmaids \u2013 may even provoke enough of a row with the girlfriend for him to 'huff' off into the car and get the cricket on this radio.\"</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>There have been two instances</strong> of a <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;innings_number=4;orderby=team_score;qualmax1=99;qualval1=target;result=2;template=results;type=team;view=innings\">team losing a Test when chasing a target of below 100</a>: England against Australia at The Oval in 1882 and Zimbabwe in Trinidad in 2000. Sri Lanka need early wickets to have any chance, and they will surely start with spin from both ends.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 0-1 (Strauss b Dilshan 0)</strong> Andrew Strauss has gone in the first over! He felt down the wrong line at a delivery from the offspinner Tillakaratne Dilshan that turned to hit the off stump. It was an odd shot from Strauss, an absent-minded poke with a crooked bat and a slightly closed face.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>2nd over: England 4-1 (target: 94; Cook 3, Trott 1)</strong> It'll be spin from both ends, with Rangana Herath sharing the new ball. Cook forces three through the covers. England will be fine here; there's no need to do the whole despair thing. \"Being as I'm getting married to the beautiful Hayley Belle Furminger in a couple of hours, I feel rather chipper this fine morning,\" says Miles Geffin. \"That said, a cataclysmic batting collapse may well adversely impact on my mood. Is it terribly cowardly to pray for rain?\"</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>3rd over: England 6-1 (target: 94; Cook 4, Trott 1)</strong> England are playing more positively than they did in that Abu Dhabi run-chase, when they stood passively while the soil fell over their head. Trott misses a pull at Dilshan and then flicks a single to midwicket. Cook pushes another single into the off side. \"Regardless of whether you publish this, please forward it to Daudi Were as a matter of urgency: yes, definitely trousers under a kanzu,\" says Josh Robinson. \"These things are sufficiently translucent that not wearing them will be a considerable social faux pas. If you weren't already posting on the OBO I'd also suggest that it would injure your dignity.\"</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>REVIEW! England 8-1 (Trott not out 2)</strong> Trott survives a huge shout for LBW from Herath, and Sri Lanka are going to review the decision. He played around his pad at a fullish delivery; I don't think it straightened enough to  hit the stumps. Hawkeye shows it was indeed missing leg stump, so Trott continues.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>4th over: England 9-1 (target: 94; Cook 6, Trott 2)</strong> \"I'm following the action from the beach in Peru, explaining the delights of five day cricket to a Dutchman,\" says Chris Hodgson. \"I'm also the manager of the Peruvian national cricket team \u2013 any chance of a shout out to the Llamas?\" Damn straight. Go follow them on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/CricketPeru\">that Twitter thing</a>.\"</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>5th over: England 11-1 (target: 94; Cook 7, Trott 3)</strong> Two from Dilshan's over. The ball isn't misbehaving too much; just a little uneven bounce and the odd bit of sharp spin. \"I'm following the OBO from Kigali, which is a little like Slough, in case anyone was thinking of visiting,\" touristboards Will Rollason. \"In response to Daudi Were (over 115), and as a professional anthropologist, I can confidently say that in questions of other peoples' traditional costume: trousers, always trousers.\"</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>6th over: England 13-1 (target: 94; Cook 8, Trott 4)</strong> Trott inside edges a quicker one from Herath onto the pad. Run-scoring will not be easy unless KP goes mad again but England are going about this in the right way, looking for singles whenever possible.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>7th over: England 22-1 (target: 94; Cook 17, Trott 4)</strong> A good over for England begins when Cook smashes Dilshan straight down the ground for four, an effective agricultural blow. The next ball is a peach that turns sharply to take a thick edge. The ball after that is too short and cut decisively for four more.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>8th over: England 27-1 (target: 94; Cook 22, Trott 4)</strong> Four more to Cook, slammed through the covers when Herath drops one short and wide. He has raced to 21 from 31 balls. \"How jaded by his own success is Chris Hodgson (4th over)?\" says Matt Dony. \"He emails in to say he's on a beach, and then as an afterthought mentions that he just happens to be manager of an international sports team?\"</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>9th over: England 31-1 (target: 94; Cook 25, Trott 5)</strong> Cook pats Dilshan into the leg side for two and is then beaten by a beauty from Dilshan. Asad Rauf goes to the third umpire to check the stumping, just in case, but Cook was fine. </p><p>\"If it helps Robin Hazelhurst feel any worse, it's also warm and sunny in Saigon,\" says Dan Hatfield. \"Not as warm and sunny as Colombo though \u2013 I got back from there yesterday. Highlights of the trip include watching KP make his 151 and my insane Irish friend essentially molesting Ian Botham in the hotel bar.\"</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 31-2 (Trott LBW b Herath 5)</strong> That's not a bad shout for LBW, you know. Trott pushed forward at Herath, bat and pad very close together, and the ball hit him on the front pad around the line of off stump. There was a fairly muted shout for LBW from Sri Lanka. Asad Rauf said not out but Jayawardene, almost as an afterthought, decided to risk the last review. This will be close. He was a long way forward but bounce is rarely an issue with Herath. Did Trott get outside the line? He's out! It was in line and hitting middle and leg halfway up. Is that one last DRS wicket for the plane or the start of a tragifarcical collapse?</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>10th over: England 34-2 (target: 94; Cook 26, Pietersen 2)</strong> Pietersen comes down the track to his first ball, driving it to mid on for a single. \"Congratulations to Miles and the soon to be (please please please) Mrs Hayley Belle Furminger-Geffen,\" says Niall Mullen. I don't get the joke. It's not rude is it? <em>Is something brilliant happening?</em></p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>11th over: England 39-2 (target: 94; Cook 30, Pietersen 3)</strong> It's friends reunited, with Dilshan bowling to Pietersen. He sweeps a single and then Cook cuts crisply for four. He is playing very nicely.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>12th over: England 44-2 (target: 94; Cook 33, Pietersen 5)</strong> Four from Herath's over. England are cruising. Put the Starship song on. \"Alas that is very rude,\" says Ian Copestake. \"In German Hayley Belle Furminger-Geffen euphemistically translated means, England are going to flaming well ballls this up.\"</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>13th over: England 46-2 (target: 94; Cook 34, Pietersen 6)</strong> Suraj Randiv is coming on in place of Tillakaratne Dilshan. This will be interesting, because he was savaged by Pietersen in the first innings, who hit him for 39 from 17 deliveries. Here he settles for a single through point.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>14th over: England 47-2 (target: 94; Cook 35, Pietersen 6)</strong> Cook, trying to cut, is beaten thrice by quicker balls from Herath. That was beautifully bowled. \"What are the chances of the weather saving England?\" says Robin Hazlehurst? \"Any sign of rain around there? Or snow? They can have some of ours, we've got loads of the [rude word] stuff to spare. In April. At Easter. Hayley Belle Furminger-Geffen doesn't even come close to describing it.\" Apparently they did have the covers ready earlier, but it all looks fine from my King's Cross vantage point.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>15th over: England 53-2 (target: 94; Cook 41, Pietersen 6)</strong> A fine stroke from Cook, who drills Randiv through extra cover for four to take England past 50. Nothing can go wrong for England here, and I'm not just saying that so as to tempt fate because I'm a tension junkie.</p><p>\"I'm following this from a beach in Bali where I'm married to the president's daughter and captain the international swingball team,\" says Peter Harmer. \"Fine, that's a lie. I'm following from a mattress on the floor of a small flat in N London. I'm sorry, I just felt so inadequate.\" </p><p>What's the most Mittyish thing any of you have done? Come on, out with it. I think I tried to impress a girl once by telling her I'd spoken to Lauren Laverne after a gig. Not made out with her or anything jazzy; <em>spoken</em> to her. Talk about aiming high.</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><strong>16th over: England 63-2 (target: 94; Cook 41, Pietersen 16)</strong> Effortless brutality from Pietersen, who gives Herath the charge and drives him down the ground for a wonderful flat six. That's Pietersen's seventh six of the match, a new record for this fixture. The next ball is blitzed emphatically over mid off for four more.</p><p>\"It's my 15th wedding anniversary today,\" says Simon McMahon. \"1997, England had just returned from New Zealand and an Ashes summer was about to begin. 600 Tests later, however, and despite my best efforts, Mrs McMahon (and now two daughters, Evie and Anna) have not the slightest interest in this wonderful game. Maybe  a mention in the OBO will change their mind? And make up for the fact that I forgot to buy a present (15 is crystal, apparently).\" You could always buy her Lawrence Booth's Wisden Almanack 2012 as a belated present. I hear the statistical analysis of the first 2000 Tests is to <em>die</em> for.</p><!-- Block 58 --><p><strong>17th over: England 71-2 (target: 94; Cook 42, Pietersen 22)</strong> Pietersen switch hits Randiv to third man for four. All above board this time, as he did not switch his hands until Randiv was into his delivery stride. Pietersen has 22 from 19 balls; he is batting like a lord.</p><p>\"Talk of Doddie Weir, however tangentially, always reminds me of the peerless Bill McLaren's description of him as 'on the charge like a mad giraffe',\" says Stephen Davenport. \"Which is perhaps only surpassed by Simon Geoghegan's appearance at the ruck: 'all arms and legs like a mad octopus'. Cricket commentary could do with a few more zoological similes, don't you think?\" Definitely. Sky had Freddie Flintoff commentating on the Darts in 2010; they should return the favour and get Sid Waddell in for a county game.</p><!-- Block 59 --><p><strong>18th over: England 76-2 (target: 94; Cook 46, Pietersen 23)</strong> Dilshan replaces Herath and is cut for four by Cook. \"There was a long queue in the nightclub cloakrooms once, so me and two other chaps kept our coats on in the meantime,\" says Robin Hazlehurst. \"A charming and very attractive young lady came over to us and asked why we had leather jackets on, so I obviously replied that it was because we were members of the Russian mafia. When she looked nonplussed I pulled out a Russian visa from my pocket and told her it was my mafia ID. She walked off looking more pitying than impressed. Apparently Russian mafioso is not a very good thing to claim to be if you want to wow the ladies.\" Do you have a cut-glass accent? Maybe that gave the game away.</p><!-- Block 60 --><p><strong>19th over: England 81-2 (target: 94; Cook 49, Pietersen 26)</strong> Herath has changed ends. That probably means the end of a disappointing match for Randiv, who took just one wicket for 123. Cook repels a spitting delivery and then sweeps over the top for a couple. \"It's my 20th anniversary,\" says David Toze. \"As a failsafe, I bought myself a copy of \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cricket-Golden-Extraordinary-Images-1859/dp/184403237X\">Cricket the Golden Age</a>\" by Duncan Steer, since no one else was going to buy it for me. If anyone out there is interested as to why famous fast bowling metrosexual Bob Willis says \"the luncheon interval\" the answer is on P236\u2026\" I'm confused. It's <em>your</em> 20th? And you bought a present for yourself? Does that mean you're married to you?</p><!-- Block 61 --><p><strong>19.4 overs: England 97-2. ENGLAND WIN BY EIGHT WICKETS (Cook 49, Pietersen 42)</strong> Pietersen ends the match in a hurry, larruping his BFF Dilshan for 16 from four consecutive deliveries, the last of those a lofted six over midwicket. He ends with 42 from 28 balls and 193 from 193 balls in the match. That's an astonishing performance on an awkward pitch, and he and Graeme Swann will now have a zesty, borderline-homoerotic arm-wrestle for the Man of the Match award. More importantly, England have won the match, drawn the series and ensured they will be No1 in the Test rankings when they play the West Indies next month.</p><p>That's an excellent victory for England, a happy ending to a difficult few months. Thanks for your emails throughout the winter. See you in a few weeks for the West Indies series.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=England+in+Sri+Lanka+2012&k=England+cricket+team&k=Sri+Lanka+cricket+team&k=Cricket&k=Sport&k=Over+by+over+reports\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Sri+Lanka+v+England+-+as+it+happened+%7C+Rob+Smyth+Article+1728271&ch=Sport&c2=148491&c4=England+in+Sri+Lanka+2012%2CEngland+cricket+team%2CSri+Lanka+cricket+team%2CCricket%2CSport%2COver+by+over+reports&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Rob+Smyth&c7=12-Apr-07&c8=1728271&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/2012/apr/07/sri-lanka-england-live|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|6883f81d12d3068906cb3b0bdcbaeddcb8f30527 -->",

        "body":"<p><strong>I have been subfertile since I was 20.&nbsp;I&nbsp;am now 30 and about to undergo my last lot of IVF. &nbsp;My husband and I&nbsp;have decided there is no point in flogging a&nbsp;dead horse \u2013 my eggs are like those of&nbsp;someone much older, due&nbsp;to the complex medical issues behind the infertility. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Throughout our relationship, my husband has had a friend with various drug and alcohol problems. He is now sober-ish and has&nbsp;met someone and, after a month, they decided to start trying to conceive. Because of her fertility issues with her last partner, they are&nbsp;trying to get a referral for IVF. They are in their mid- to late-30s. I&nbsp;dread them succeeding where we may fail. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>I know it is not a failure as such, but I do not think I would be able to cope with my husband's friend becoming a&nbsp;father and my husband not. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>The friend and the new girl have moved in together, and he is not in employment and not sober either. My&nbsp;husband is the only one who offered support through his 20-year-plus drug issues.&nbsp;He is now just drinking, and emotionally stuck at 17. Every time they argue, he declares it is over and we are expected to comfort his girlfriend of three months \u2013 yet they are still trying for a baby. I could&nbsp;scream!</strong></p><p><strong>In the past 10 years, I have navigated so many pregnancies, and we have three close friends who are pregnant: it&nbsp;does not bother me, but this friend does. I fear I am being unfair in focusing my anger on this man. I feel no emotion for the girlfriend; I would not wish her to remain childless. But I&nbsp;dread him having a baby, especially at this time in my life. </strong></p><p><strong>This feeling is magnified when I think that, in the last five years, we have ended up having to rescue three of his pets. I don't anticipate having to&nbsp;do the same with a baby, really, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;am so bitter and angry that I am trying to avoid them, as the thought of&nbsp;his happiness makes me want to hurt him. What can I do? <em>L</em></strong></p><p></p><p>I would be amazed if, after what you have been through, you weren't angry, bitter and feeling that life was unfair. You need to allow yourself to have these feelings: they are valid. It is OK to rant against the world. But some of your feelings are tipping over into something else, and to be able to move on, you need to address where the wound lies.</p><p>I contacted <a href=\"http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Philippa Whittick, a systemic family psychotherapist</a>. She wondered what the friend represents: \"Who is he in your transference? Who does he represent? Why do you identify with him and not the girlfriend?\"</p><p>Because while it is perfectly understandable for you to feel angry, when one person triggers the depth of feeling he does, there is usually something else going on too.</p><p>It could be that to rant against the world, at this unfairness, is too abstract for you, you may need a \"target\" and it may be easier \u2013 less damaging \u2013 to have this friend as the bullseye than, say, your husband. I am not saying you  <em>should</em> also be angry at your husband, but I wondered if you <em>might</em> be.</p><p>Have you told your husband how you&nbsp;feel? I can't help thinking that you&nbsp;haven't. I&nbsp;wonder why your husband feels he keeps having to bail out this friend.</p><p>Whittick thought it would be really helpful for you both to see a therapist together to \"explore what it's like for them to be a couple who want a child and can't have one. What nerve has this man and his girlfriend hit? What's stopping you from saying: 'What a great opportunity for them, this might be the making of them?'\" She also thought it would be a good opportunity for you to talk about the \"triangular\" friendship you and your husband have with this friend.</p><p>Sometimes, when one can't have a&nbsp;child, various other people may become pregnant and it does not trigger anything, but then, one particular couple has a baby and suddenly, all those emotions come flooding out.</p><p>Do you feel as if they are having your baby \u2013 the baby you should have had? Do you&nbsp;worry about your husband potentially having to be, as Whittick put it, \"parental with someone else's child\" \u2013 viz the idea that you may be left looking after, in some way, this couple's baby?</p><h2>Your problems solved</h2><p></p><p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email <a href=\"mailto:annalisa.barbieri@mac.com\" title=\"\">annalisa.barbieri@mac.com</a>.

        "headline":"A spot of bothy: your cabin in the Cairngorms",
        "body":"<p>\"Did you ever see that film Into the Wild?\" asked my friend Helen, looking a bit nervous.</p><p>\"The one about the man who gets eaten by bears?\"</p><p>\"No, the one where he goes to Alaska, kills a moose, fails to save its meat from some wolves, then eats a wild berry and poisons himself to death.\"</p><p>Our patch of wilderness was in fact only four miles from Aviemore, in the Cairngorms national park, but the cabin we were staying in had been specifically designed for visitors seeking isolation and a self-sufficient, back-to-nature experience in the great Scottish outdoors. A one-room hut with a platform bed, table, bench seat, sofa, sink and stove, the corrugated iron bothy crouches like a minimalist doll's house in a secluded birch- and bracken-speckled dell.</p><p>Stoking the fire and lighting candle lanterns in the all-but-silent gloaming, we felt miles from civilisation, But the dell is in a far corner of the grounds of Inshriach House (<a href=\"http://inshriachhouse.com/\" title=\"Inshriach House\">inshriachhouse.com</a>), a sensitively and sustainably restored Edwardian manor originally built by the A&amp;C Black publishing family but now run as a large holiday home by former antiques dealer turned set designer and all-round handyman Walter Micklethwait and his mother Lucy, a children's author.</p><p>The Micklethwaits already have experience in catering for off-grid guests, renting out a yurt in another corner of the grounds, and a pimped-up 1950s lorry, the Beer Moth, that has been converted into a campervan for two, with parquet floor, woodburning stove and Victorian brass-framed double bed. There is also temporary camping for around 800 people each June when Inshriach plays host to The Insider festival (<a href=\"http://www.insiderfestival.com/\" title=\"Insider Festival\">insiderfestival.com</a>).</p><p>The bothy, however, has been designed with a more challenging clientele in mind \u2013 artists. The creation of architectural designer Iain MacLeod and artist Bobby Niven, it is a response to grants they won through the Royal Scottish Academy's Residencies for Scotland scheme. Instead of using the money for individual residencies they decided to build a lasting legacy \u2013 a bothy that could be used by other artists as an ongoing residency space.</p><p>In time they hope The Bothy Project (<a href=\"http://thebothyproject.org/\" title=\"The Bothy Project\">thebothyproject.org</a>) will develop into a network of small-scale residency spaces around Scotland and beyond. The main aim is to provide a way for artists to explore the history, ecology, landscape and people of a place, but with this first space, built at Inshriach in collaboration with Walter and the Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop, MacLeod and Niven are inadvertently trialling a pioneering idea: the crossover between tourism and art.</p><p>It's a simple but clever solution to a funding shortfall. To pay the bothy's costs and keep it running, the building will be rented out to paying guests on various dates each year; it will be available to member artists for the rest of the year.</p><p>This ties in with a growing trend towards recreational spaces that present a more earthy, Walden-esque existence. For every tourist attracted by a fly-and-flop sunshine resort, there's another seeking an escape from their frenzied, over-digitised life in a space where all they have to think about is feeding a fire, gazing at the stars and cooking simple, foraged foods.</p><p>The Bothy Project is part of the same widespread attack of cabin fever that has seen a surge of interest in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/jan/05/scottish-hutting-campaign-2012\" title=\"\">hutting in Scotland</a> and a rise in services such as the cult Cabin Porn website (<a href=\"http://freecabinporn.com/\" title=\"Free Cabin Porn\">freecabinporn.com</a>), which streams images of fabulously photogenic huts, cabins and cottages to desk-bound wilderness-wannabees.</p><p>With only two nights at Inshriach and one full day, Helen and I wanted to get to grips with our immediate surroundings before the light disappeared.</p><p>\"The whole place was designed around the windows \u2013 recycled sashes from Bobby's Glasgow flat \u2013 and a ladder found in a skip outside Glasgow School of Art that now leads up to the sleeping platform,\" said Walter. \"Between its wooden frame and a coating of corrugated iron is a hefty layer of sheep's wool insulation.\"</p><p>There's also a reclaimed wooden floor, rainwater harvesting for washing (and washing up) and some kitchen essentials \u2013 a starter pack of eggs from Walter and Lucy's chickens, fruit, milk, tea and coffee, oats, candles, pots and pans, a corkscrew and a toasting rack. Once the stove is on it's surprisingly cosy (no need for the hot water bottles and thermals we'd packed) and a short walk away there's a compost loo with a view, strung with solar-powered fairy lights that we are glad of on a cloudy, moonless night, since the path to it isn't very well-trodden yet.</p><p>Begun last July and finished the day Helen and I arrived, in mid-March, the bothy was largely built with volunteer labour from Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop. \"We wanted to do something bespoke and interesting,\" said Walter. \"If this looks relatively simple, that's deliberate \u2013 it has been designed not to impose too much of an aesthetic on the artists who come here.</p><p>\"There's something about buildings with no power and made with natural materials that is just really good for the soul,\" he said as we finished our tea and fell into a fire-lulled lethargy. With woodsmoke curling away through the chimney and the last of the sunset retreating through the surrounding trees it became clear just how contemplative and introspective a space this might be. But if we thought we were in for a quiet night, Walter had other plans. We piled into a car and headed down to the Old Bridge Inn (<a href=\"http://oldbridgeinn.co.uk/\" title=\"Old Bridge Inn\">oldbridgeinn.co.uk</a>), outside Aviemore. There, we washed down perfectly cooked sea bream and spinach (£15) with bottles of Cairngorm Gold and peppery pinot noir, and settled in for the night as fiddles, guitars, drums and a double bass squeezed past us to an impromptu stage.</p><p>The next morning we woke to another surprise. Hanging on the door of the hut was a red and white checked napkin, tied up Dick Whittington-style around a pile of fresh croissants, butter and jam.</p><p>We sat eating our croissants to the sound of a woodpecker hammering in a nearby tree. Surrounded by Forestry Commission land and the Rothiemurchus Estate, the bothy has access to some of the best biking, kayaking and, in the winter, skiing in Scotland. We wanted to avoid another drive, though, so we set off on foot to Loch an Eilein, a small lake around three miles away with a ruined castle in its middle. It was once a stronghold of the fearsome Wolf of Badenoch (1343\u20131405) the third surviving son of King Robert II of Scotland.</p><p>We rewarded ourselves afterwards with tea and homemade cake at Inshriach Nursery's Potting Shed Tearoom (<a href=\"http://inshriachnursery.co.uk/\" title=\"Inshriach Nursery\">inshriachnursery.co.uk</a>), enjoying slices of chocolate torte and fresh berry sponge respectively from vintage china plates as a feathery flying squad dipped and bobbed around the feeders strung up just outside the room's long back window.</p><p>Later that evening, we settled back in by the bothy's fire, warming soup on the stove and chatting over the spit and crack of smouldering logs. There was something we had to do before turning in for the night, though. Heating water on the stove, mixing it with rainwater and hooking it up in a special sack within a marginally modesty-preserving curve of the decking, we took it in turns to shower under the stars in the dark and the stillness, listening only to the sound of the river swirling below. This may be a back-to-nature experience but it comes with some luxuries that even Aviemore's fanciest hotels can't provide.</p><p><em>\u2022 The bothy, which sleeps two, costs from £95 a night through Canopy &amp; Stars (01275 395447,</em><a href=\"http://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/scotland/highland/insriach-house/the-bothy-project\" title=\"\"><em>canopyandstars.co.uk/the-bothy-project</em></a><em>.

        "headline":"Sri Lanka v England \u2013 as it happened",
        "body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p><strong>Preamble</strong> One push. One final push for Queen, Country and the bloody ICC Test rankings. England's bowlers have been marvellous all winter, entirely beyond reproach. Now, for the first time, they have something to bowl at. Sri Lanka will resume on four for nought, a deficit of 181. It's hard to know quite what we should expect on this two-faced pitch, but England probably have just over four sessions to bowl Sri Lanka out.</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>There was a not insignificant nerdish thrill at around 12.40pm yesterday</strong>, when Dhammika Prasad walked out to open the batting for Sri Lanka. A nightwatchman opener! I thought it might have been a first in Test cricket. In an usual development, I was wrong. Here is hot, scorecard-based evidence that <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/403367.html\">Rangana Herath</a> was a nightwatchman opener in 2009.</p><p>Other unlikely Test-match openers (but not as nightwatchmen) include Morne Morkel (!), Danny Morrrison (!!), Martin Snedden, Tahir Naqqash, Bruce Yardley and Peter Taylor. This is the <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?batting_positionmax1=2;batting_positionval1=batting_position;class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=start;orderbyad=reverse;qualmax1=1;qualmin1=1;qualval1=innings;template=results;type=batting\">full list of players</a> who have opened the batting only once in Test cricket.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>2nd over: Sri Lanka 8-0 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 0, Thirimanne 4)</strong> Lahiru Thirimanne gets off the mark by steering Steven Finn's second delivery to the third-man boundary.</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>3rd over: Sri Lanka 14-0 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 4, Thirimanne 5)</strong> Anderson has a big shout for LBW against Prasad first ball, but it jagged back sharply and did too much. A good decision from Asad Rauf. Prasad gets off the mark later in the over with an expansive drive on the up past mid off for four. Shot!</p><p>\"I can't sleep for some reason,\" says George. \"Come on England!\" I woke up about eight times between 1am and 3am. I'm shattered. I haven't really sorted out a decent sleep pattern for this series. Thankfully it's not an eight-match series or the last day's OBO would consist of little more than wibble. (Insert your own joke here.)</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>4th over: Sri Lanka 18-0 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 6, Thirimanne 7)</strong> Four singles from Finn's over. This has been a decent start from Sri Lanka, with the ball not really deviating for the England bowlers. England won't chase wickets, of course. They are used to playing the long game when it comes to winkling out 10 second-innings wickets.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>5th over: Sri Lanka 18-0 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 6, Thirimanne 7)</strong> Prasad is beaten by a couple of fine lifters and then spoons a drive in the air but just wide of the bowler Anderson. A maiden.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>6th over: Sri Lanka 19-0 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 6, Thirimanne 8)</strong> One from Finn's over. Not much is happening.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>7th over: Sri Lanka 22-0 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 6, Thirimanne 11)</strong> A bit fuller from Anderson, and Thirimanne drives nicely through the covers for three. Sri Lanka will be really pleased with this start. \"I'm in Sydney watching on TV and feeling sorry for the Barmy Army that they can't drink today,\" says Lu Forbes. \"Watching cricket on TV in Australia normally means some really dodgy adverts featuring cricketers \u2013 I've just seen an awful one for deodorant featuring Ricky Ponting, and it <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-8F4EM_edk&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player\">reminded me of this</a>. Keep an eye on the left-hand side for the inappropriate dancing...\" Oh, <em>Doug</em>.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>8th over: Sri Lanka 22-0 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 6, Thirimanne 11)</strong> Graeme Swann replaces Steven Finn. He has a slip, gully and short leg for the left-handed Thirimanne \u2013 and Matt Prior misses a straightforward stumping chance! It was a fine delivery from Swann that lured Thirimanne down the track and zipped past the edge, but the usually reliable Prior just dropped the ball. That was a sitter. Two balls later survives a big LBW appeal after offering no stroke. England decide not to use a review, and Hawkeye shows it was missing off stump.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 23-1 (Thirimanne c Strauss b Anderson 11)</strong> Jimmy Anderson strikes! Thirimanne fenced at a good delivery slanted across him, and Strauss took a comfortable catch at first slip. It moved off the pitch just enough to take the edge. Matt Prior will be a very, very, very, very, very, very, <em>very</em> happy man: that missed stumping didn't cost England a cent, or a run.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>9th over: Sri Lanka 26-1 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 9, Dilshan 1)</strong> Anderson has had Thirimanne's number all series. Their head-to-head record is 11 runs, 43 balls and three wickets.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>10th over: Sri Lanka 28-1 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 10, Dilshan 2)</strong> Some sharp turn and bounce for Swann in his second over. These are really good signs for England.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>11th over: Sri Lanka 34-1 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 16, Dilshan 2)</strong> Dilshan and Pietersen had a few words between overs. Dilshan was unhappy that Cook had skipped across the pitch at the end of Swann's over, and mentioned it to the umpire, which was where Pietersen came in. Prasad steers Anderson to third man for four and then digs out a fine yorker.</p><p>\"Have any other OBO followers been plagued by reoccuring cricket-related dreams?\" says Cal Cleary. \"These nocturnal mind f**cks have become increasingly vivid and frequent since I moved to the other side of the Atlantic. I once had one in which whilst on tour to the West Country, me and the entire touring party were kidnapped by a Cornish separatist movement. Of course we were all fully kitted out, glove and all, and forced to drink paint stripper. After this, and Cameron's admitance to his penchant for western pastries, I've never looked at a Ginsters in the same way. Another one, involved a missing out on running out Nasser Hussain after gracefully gliding down to scoop up a ball in the covers and realising that it had turned into Blu-Tack.\"</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>12th over: Sri Lanka 41-1 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 21, Dilshan 4)</strong> After a bit more <del>bante</del> chat between Anderson and Prasad, the two umpires walk over to Andrew Strauss to say something, presumably along the lines of \"enough's enough\". When Swann's over begins, Prasad gloves a lifter between Prior and Anderson at slip for four. And now Prasad has been dropped! He blitzed Swann straight to mid off, where Finn put down a sharp but ultimately routine chance. It's rare to see England miss two such straightforward chances in the field in a day's play, never mind in the first hour.</p><p>\"Lu Forbes (7th over) might be interested to know that not only does Ricky Ponting flog deodorant, he used to host a television show (sponsored by a deodorant manufacturer) featuring elite athletes competing in various sporting challenges in order to be crowned 'Australia's Greatest Athlete',\" says Matt Kwan.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>13th over: Sri Lanka 43-1 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 22, Dilshan 5)</strong> Jimmy Anderson is replaced by Steven Finn. There were more words between Anderson and Prasad at the end of that Swann over. Dilshan cuffs Finn into the covers, where Patel makes a fine diving save.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>14th over: Sri Lanka 48-1 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 27, Dilshan 5)</strong> Prasad leans into a wider delivery from Swann and drills it through the covers for four. The next ball finds the inside edge and flies just wide of the diving Cook at short leg. Swann has started well and looks likely to be England's main threat.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>15th over: Sri Lanka 50-1 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 27, Dilshan 7)</strong> Finn has an LBW shout against Prasad turned down by Asad Rauf. It was going miles down leg. \"From the sounds of it (I don't have Sky), England a getting a little tetchy out there,\" says Chris Langmead. \"Why do I have a horrible feeling that after four Tests of trying to dig the batsmen out of holes, this might be the innings where it doesn't come off for the bowlers? See, it didn't take long for the 1990s paranoia to manifest itself. Perhaps this could soon be a recognised medical condition?\" Yeah, this will be hard work for England's seamers. I still expect them to win, but don't make any plans for tomorrow morning.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>16th over: Sri Lanka 51-1 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 28, Dilshan 10)</strong> A brute of a delivery from Swann turns, bounces and follows Dilshan, with the ball hitting the glove and landing safely. Dilshan slaps three to third man later in the over, but he is struggling against Swann.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>17th over: Sri Lanka 59-1 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 33, Dilshan 10)</strong> Prasad drags Finn round the corner for four to move into the thirties. He is engaging England's wick here, having made 33 very useful runs. Dilshan misses an extravagant cut later in the over. He doesn't look in great touch at all.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>18th over: Sri Lanka 63-1 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Prasad 34, Dilshan 13)</strong> We've only really considered an England win and a draw thus far today, but Sri Lanka are only 123 behind now. If they were to set England a three-figure target, on a fifth-day pitch, and with the Abu Dhabi collapse in mind, things might get interesting.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 64-2 (Prasad c Bresnan b Finn 34)</strong> Steven Finn ends the nonsense with a short ball that Prasad pulls straight to Bresnan at deep backward square leg. Not a Mensa-approved shot, really, but overall that was  good effort from the nightwatchman Prasad, a jaunty 34 from 59 balls.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>19th over: Sri Lanka 64-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 14, Sangakkara)</strong> The new batsman Kumar Sangakkara is on a pair for the third time in four Tests. Before that he had played 105 Tests \u2013 and never come to the crease on a pair. Weird, hah? He is beaten by his second and third deliveries, a couple of crackers from Finn.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>20th over: Sri Lanka 68-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 17, Sangakkara 1)</strong> Sangakkara pats Swann into the leg side to get off the mark. Swann has now moved around the wicket to the right-handed Dilshan, who steers a couple to third man.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>21st over: Sri Lanka 72-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 17, Sangakkara 5)</strong> Sangakkara edges a wide yorker from Finn low through the slips for four. Forget Sangakkara's iffy form; if he gets his eye in he has the capacity to bat for the rest of the day and beyond. In 60 Tests in which he has played purely as a batsman he has <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/50710.html?class=1;filter=advanced;keeper=0;orderby=default;template=results;type=batting;view=innings\">an astonishing average of 67.19</a>.</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>22nd over: Sri Lanka 75-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 20, Sangakkara 5)</strong> Dilshan takes a dodgy third to deep cover, and a better throw might have given Sangakkara problems. \"England are paying for a pogonophobic selection policy this morning,\" says Keith Flett. \"Monty's Beard Power would have the match won by lunch.\"</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>23rd over: Sri Lanka 78-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 23, Sangakkara 5)</strong> There was a little reverse swing in Finn's previous over, so it's a good time for Tim Bresnan to bowl. If England can pick up one more wicket in the 20 minutes before lunch they will be really pleased with their morning's work. The second ball comes back in to Dilshan, who drags an attempted cut into his pads. That could have gone anywhere.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>24th over: Sri Lanka 81-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 25, Sangakkara 6)</strong> Three from Swann's over, who then leaves the field at the end of the over. He doesn't look in any real discomfort.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>25th over: Sri Lanka 81-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 25, Sangakkara 6)</strong> Bresnan is certainly getting the ball to shape back into Dilshan \u2013 not extravagantly, but enough for Dilshan to eschew attacking intent for the time being. A maiden. The last ball was a peach that went the other way past the edge. An excellent maiden. \"Do you have pictures of the M, the C and the A to go with that picture at the top of the page?\" says Liam Drew.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>26th over: Sri Lanka 82-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 25, Sangakkara 6)</strong> Samit Patel comes on for Graeme Swann (9-1-33-0). He has a big shout for LBW against Sangakkara, who was surely outside the line of off stump. England could argue that Sangakkara wasn't playing a shot, with his bat hidden behind the pad. It doesn't matter either way: Hawkeye shows it was just hitting the top of middle stump so we would have stayed with the on-field decision.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>27th over: Sri Lanka 84-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 25, Sangakkara 8)</strong> A quiet over from Bresnan takes us through to what Bob Willis and nobody else on the planet calls the luncheon interval. It's been a fairly even morning session, probably just in Sri Lanka's favour. England picked up two wickets, but they were the two they would have expected to claim \u2013 the nightwatchman Prasad and the out-of-form Thirimanne. They still have to winkle out Dilshan, Sangakkara, Jayawardene and Samaraweera, which won't be easy on a pitch that is nowhere near as naughty as appearances suggest. Like a frigid Page 7 fella. Something like that. Whatever. Anyway, I'm off to mainline caffeine. See you in 30 minutes.</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>Right, I'm awake now</strong>. The miracle of the flat white. Apologies for that morning session, which was a bit of a struggle. It's going to be a grind for England's bowlers for the rest of the day, so we need something else to talk about. Any suggestions?</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>Lunchtime viewing</strong>. Just in case you haven't seen it.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>8.01am GMT / 3.01am ET</strong> The good news is somebody has gone to the trouble of sending in a load of riff suggestions. The bad news is that persion is Mac Millings. \"Times when you have found the courage to speak to that cute girl/boy, only for the result to remind you why you had developed such mortal fear of doing that in the first place; flashbacks to things that make you shudder with shame even 30 years after the fact; times when you have been entrusted with the care of your baby for five whole minutes, only to turn around and find that she is sitting in her baby carrier in a puddle of her own excrement, and, in your attempt to clean her up, you get the waste matter all over her body, her hair, and yourself, with no change of clothes for either of you, in the middle of a packed theme park.\" </p><p>Recycling old jokes department: Millings has two children. I know, <em>twice</em>.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>8.02am GMT / 3.02am ET</strong> I've just realised it's Good Friday. This means the Guardian canteen doesn't open at 8am as usual. I've got the face on. No toast for Robbie till the tea break!</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>28th over: Sri Lanka 85-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 26, Sangakkara 8)</strong> It's often said you should start a session with your best bowlers. Here comes Samit Patel, then. He has a pretty big shout for LBW against Sangakkara, similar to the one before lunch. Sangakkara was certainly outside the line, but he had his bat hidden behind the pad. England ask Bruce Oxenford if he thought Sangakkara was playing a shot; he says yes, so England don't review. Hawkeye shows it was missing leg anyway. </p><p>\"It's all set for KP to get Jayawardene's wicket today with his part-time spin,\" says Mark Hooper. \"In the nineties, just as England are losing hope.\" They have to get to Jayawardene first.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>29th over: Sri Lanka 86-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 27, Sangakkara 8)</strong> Jimmy Anderson will start at the other end. He has an average of 0.5 against Sangakkara in this series; one run, two wickets. That average almost <em>shoots</em> up to 2.5, but Sangakkara fails to put a wide full toss away. Anderson is hiding the ball, which is a sign that the ball is reverse swinging. Only a touch, but that's good news for England. In other news, Dilshan has been fined 10 per cent of his match fee for excessive appealing yesterday. \"And no 8.8% Lion Stout for me as it's Poya Day, so no alcohol,\" weeps Mike Selvey. Talking of ABV, there are a few places that now serve this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delirium_Tremens_%28beer%29\">jaunty little liverbuster on tap</a>. The mind boggles.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>30th over: Sri Lanka 89-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 28, Sangakkara 10)</strong> There is some turn for Patel, although nothing like the bite Swann got before lunch. Dilshan, who has been unusually placid in this innings, drives a single to long off before Sangakkara squirts a couple through point. \"I have a third child now, three months old, meaning that I've been at it again, approximately a year ago to the day,\" says Mac Millings. \"Which leads me to another riff \u2013 giving people mental images that you hope will scar them indefinitely.\"</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>31st over: Sri Lanka 89-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 28, Sangakkara 10)</strong> A good maiden from Anderson to Dilshan, whose only real option is to defend carefully. Dilshan hasn't hit a single boundary in this innings, even though he has faced nearly 60 balls.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>32nd over: Sri Lanka 94-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 28, Sangakkara 15)</strong> Sangakkara drives Patel through the covers for four. I'd be inclined to get Swann back on at this end. Patel is bowling okay but he's essentially a part-time spinner.</p><p>\"Enjoying the Test match out here in Sydney,\" says John Clarke. \"You mentioned yesterday that you pay 21p for your toast. I can remember as a kid, after swimming in the Steble Street baths in Liverpool, we would go to the canteen and buy thick slices of hot buttered toast for a penny. Er! An old penny. 1d. That's inflation for you!\" And Guardian canteen prices. My snout tells me it's only 19p at the Times.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>33rd over: Sri Lanka 96-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 28, Sangakkara 17)</strong> This is a very good spell from Anderson, whose accuracy and ability to move the ball both ways means that the batsmen are unable to take even a solitary liberty. Sangakkara leaves a delivery that doesn't miss off stump by much and flicks a couple off the pads.</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>34th over: Sri Lanka 103-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 34, Sangakkara 18)</strong> Dilshan flicks Patel through midwicket for three to bring up the 100. It's too early to say this is ominous for England, but it's clear that they will have to work bloody hard if they are to win this. The pitch isn't doing too much. There is occasional low bounce, and some bite for Swann, but it's far from a minefield.</p><p>\"Bob Dylan said you don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows,\" says Coachie Ballgames. \"But in this case we most certainly do, forecast calls for chance of <a href=\"http://www.weather.com/weather/hourbyhour/CEXX0001?begHour=13&amp;begDay=98\">thundershowers during tomorrow afternoon's play</a>, just as the chase could be nearing its end.....\" Never trust a weatherman. He just wants the golf course to be empty.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>35th over: Sri Lanka 104-2 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Dilshan 35, Sangakkara 18)</strong> Dilshan throws the bat at a reverse inswinger from Anderson, inside edging it wide of leg stump. Then Sangakkara is almost bowled behind his legs when he misses an attempted flick. That didn't miss by much at all. This is a fine demonstration of old-ball bowling from Anderson. In fact you know it's been a good spell when the bowling figures double up as a football formation. Anderson's figures for this spell are 4-1-4-1.</p><p>\"Do you remember the days when we'd wonder whether or not Good Jimmy or Bad Jimmy would show up?\" says David Horn. \"Seems a long time ago now \u2026\" He's been particularly good since David Saker became bowling coach \u2013 in that time he has <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/player/8608.html?class=1;spanmin1=01+Apr+2010;spanval1=span;template=results;type=bowling;view=innings\">102 Test wickets at 22.91</a>.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 104-3 (Dilshan c Anderson b Swann 35)</strong> Graeme Swann strikes with the first ball of a new spell \u2013 but Dilshan reviews the decision instantly. He was given out caught at slip, apparently via an inside edge onto pad. There were two noises, but the bat also hit the ground. The issue here is whether there is enough evidence to overturn the decision. Without Hotspot, I don't know if there is. I suspect Dilshan didn't hit that, but can we be certain? This could go either way. The inside edge was so close to the ball, with no daylight between the two.</p><p>This is the old problem with DRS: instinct says not out, but there is no clear evidence that it was a howler. I've a feeling he'll get away with this. The angle from the stump cam is slightly better, and appears to show a smidgin of daylight between bat and pad. Maybe. Hmm, this is so difficult to judge. Whichever side doesn't get the decision here will be aggrieved.</p><p>The third umpire Rod Tucker is in an invidious position. He's still looking at replays; we've seen at least 20 now. Here comes the decision ... <strong>he's out</strong>! Dilshan is shaking his head as he walks off. It's yet another DRS controversy. More importantly, it's a huge wicket for England.</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>REVIEW! Sri Lanka 105-3 (Sangakkara not out 18)</strong> Sangakkara plays outside the line of a straight one from Swann, with his bat stuck behind the front pad, and this looks a very good shout for LBW. Bruce Oxenford says not out, so England go for the <strong>review</strong>. This is very close. It hit him in line \u2013 but Hawkeye shows it was just hitting the top of the off stump, so we stay with the umpire's call: Sangakkara is not out. That could be a huge moment in the game.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>36th over: Sri Lanka 105-3 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Sangakkara 18, M Jayawardene 1)</strong> Both sides have one review remaining.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>37th over: Sri Lanka 106-3 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Sangakkara 18, M Jayawardene 2)</strong> Finn replaces Anderson. The Sri Lankan coach Graham Ford has been in to see the match referee about that decision. I'm not sure what else the third umpire Rod Tucker could have done. There was a suggestion of daylight between bat and pad from the stump cam, but I don't know if it was conclusive. </p><p>\"If you must know,\" says Mike Selvey, \"I'm going round in circles here trying to feed my twitter frenzy (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/selvecricket\">@selvecricket don't forget</a>), blogging on the world cricket forum, reading the county forum live (much imitated, never bettered despite Mr Hopps's assertion that his rival will be funnier etc: <em>#inyourdreams</em>), checking Cricinfo, my mailbox, and, oh yes, watching the Test match. None of which is easy to do when you are<br />disappearing up your own arse.\" The moral of the story? It's never too late to have an internet-based midlife crisis.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>38th over: Sri Lanka 107-3 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Sangakkara 18, M Jayawardene 3)</strong> This is the big partnership. It always is. Only three pairs have <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;template=results;type=fow\">added more runs in Test cricket that Sangakkara and Jayawardene</a>, and two of these were opening partnerships. Jayawardene sweeps a single off Swann. On commentary, Sanath Jayasuriya is citing the Alastair Cook review yesterday, which was not disimilar to Dilshan's, but he's missing the point. Cook was originally given not out, Dilshan out, and in each case there was no conclusive evidence to overturn the decision. As it happens I suspect Cook did hit it and Dilshan didn't, but that doesn't matter in the context of the DRS procedure as it currently exists.</p><p>\"The peace and serenity of a sunny Good Friday watching the cricket has just been disturbed,\" says David Sargen. \"There's a clear red mark that appears on the bat after the ball went through to hit the pad. Hotspot or no, that hit the bat.\" Really? If that's the case, that's a great spot.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>39th over: Sri Lanka 108-3 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Sangakkara 18, M Jayawardene 4)</strong> Jayawardene touches Finn off the hip for a single, and then Sangakkara is beaten by a lovely delivery from around the wicket that cramped him for room.</p><p>\"The extraordinary thing about Mac Millings' children is that they were born after the MBM bug bit him,\" says Gary Naylor. \"My kids were, inevitably, born before broadband.

Of course he does. Three from Swann's over. \"You want the Saker philosophy on bowling?\" says Mike Selvey. \"Quite simple. There are three deliveries: the bouncer, the yorker and the one that would hit top of offstump. That's it. Best philosophies are the simplest.\" David Saker also bowled possibly the most unplayable delivery in history, which was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dmk2aDKkTU\">almost a yorker and a bouncer at the same time</a>.</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>41st over: Sri Lanka 111-3 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Sangakkara 19, M Jayawardene 6)</strong> A maiden from Finn to Jayawardene. It appears David Sargen in the 38th over might have been right about the red mark on Dilshan's bat. How <em>fa</em>scinating. How bi<em>zarre</em>. It still doesn't quite add up. If Dilshan hit it, why did he review straight away? Maybe he just didn't feel the edge. That can happen. </p><p>\"Greetings from Abruzzo on the Adriatic coast of Italy where cricket is low on the breakfast table agenda \u2013 especially on Good Friday,\" says Mike Barron. \"My Italian isn't good enough to explain why I keep looking at OBO on my windows fone.

Sangakkara is then beauty by a snorter from Swann that turns and bounces. Swann is in his element here, particularly against the left-handed Sangakkara.</p><p>\"Former plastic surgeon and current Stag Matron Mr Benjamin Way is on his stag do in Bristol and would appreciate being dropped gently into an OBO,\" says Rossa Brugha. \"He is a bit old fashioned and didn't approve of KPs behaviour yesterday.

Nobody in world cricket bats time as well as these two, and they look in the mood for a long session of hardcore defensive batting. England's lead is 71.</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>44th over: Sri Lanka 120-3 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Sangakkara 20, M Jayawardene 14)</strong> Jayawardene turns a spitting delivery from Swann round the corner, just short of leg gully and away for four. Swann switches to around the wicket to bring the LBW into play; that was how he dismissed Jayawardene in the first innings. This is fascinating stuff, particularly at Swann's end. \"Just wanted to let you know that four OBO readers are touring the east midlands' beautiful county grounds today in support of Muscular Dystrophy,\" says Chris Ancil. \"At Grace Road in morning, Derby in afternoon and Trent Bridge in the evening \u2013 oping that game has not ended by then!

All a bit odd though. Anyway, peace and serenity have returned, so I'm having toast.\" Toast. Lovely, lovely toast.

Sri Lanka 125-4 (Sangakkara c Prior b Swann 21)</strong> Graeme Swann, you beautiful, beautiful man. This is a huge wicket for England, and it was a lovely piece of bowling from Swann. It curved gently in towards Sangakkara and then turned away to take a thin edge as Sangakkara felt tentatively outside off stump. Matt Prior took a smart catch standing up to the stumps, and Sangakkara has gone for 21 from 86 balls.</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><strong>46th over: Sri Lanka 125-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 17, Samaraweera 0)</strong> Swann has figures of 15-1-47-2.

Move over Gok, there's a new fashionista in town.</p><!-- Block 63 --><p><strong>52nd over: Sri Lanka 133-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 19, Samaraweera 7)</strong> Samaraweera pads up to a sharply spinning delivery from Swann, prompting a huge LBW appeal. It's turned down by Bruce Oxenford. England have only one review left. Don't risk it on this, chaps, don't risk it. Strauss doesn't risk it, and he's right not to do so. Hawkeye shows it was just hitting the top of off stump, so we would have stayed with the on-field decision. He's such an impressive umpire, Oxenford, not just in his decision-making but also his general demeanour. After that appeal he explained his decision to Swann \u2013 \"just can't be certain it's hitting\" \u2013 and on we go. Samaraweera jumps back in his crease to cut a classy boundary later in the over.</p><!-- Block 64 --><p><strong>53rd over: Sri Lanka 133-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 19, Samaraweera 7)</strong> Tim Bresnan comes on for Samit Patel, who has been accurate (ten overs for 21) but unthreatening (no wickets for 21). His fourth delivery keeps a bit low and is blocked by Jayawardene. A maiden.</p><!-- Block 65 --><p><strong>54th over: Sri Lanka 134-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 19, Samaraweera 8)</strong> Kevin Pietersen comes on for a couple of overs before tea. One from the over.</p><!-- Block 66 --><p><strong>55th over: Sri Lanka 136-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 19, Samaraweera 9)</strong> Bresnan has a slip and short midwicket and is bowling pretty straight, trying to maximise any uneven bounce. One from the over. \"Have I missed something?\" says Gemma Allan. \"Why no booze? I was pregnant the last time I saw England play and its just not right still being sober by the end of play. What I always thought was hilariously funny banter turns out to be drunken drivel!\" Yep, no booze: it's Poya Day in Sri Lanka.</p><!-- Block 67 --><p><strong>56th over: Sri Lanka 139-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 20, Samaraweera 11)</strong> An uneventful over from Pietersen brings us to tea. That was a compelling session: 29 overs, 55 runs, two wickets and one DRS controversy. An England win is still the likeliest result, but they need to find a way to dismiss the marvellous Mahela Jayawardene. Rob Bagchi will be with you for an extended evening session of around 35 overs \u2013 email him at <a href=\"mailto:rob.bagchi@guardian.co.uk\">rob.bagchi@guardian.co.uk</a>. See you tomorrow.</p><!-- Block 68 --><p><strong>TEA</strong> Morning everyone. Given how quickly England's innings ended yesterday I didn't have time to acknowledge some of the sterling contributions to our Likely Lads diversions. We were talking about favourite moments and Neil Waterfield supplied this gem: \"A strangely timeless line when Bob, musing on the fact that one in 10 men are reportedly gay (or whatever expression they used in the 1970s)  'so that means if you take your average football team like Leeds United, one of them is gay'. A slight pause before Terry comes back with 'Perhaps Chelsea, but not Leeds United!' And to Paul Howarth, Ross Bennett and Gary Naylor for the immortal lines from Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, Bob speaks first: </p><blockquote><p>\"I bet we could go right round the world and you'd have a pat response ready.\"<br />\"I've travelled man, I've seen a bit of the world now you know.\"<br />\"What do you think of Koreans, for instance?\"<br />\"Not to be trusted. Cruel people. Much the same as all Orientals.\"<br />\"That's a third of the world's population dismissed in a phrase. Russians?\"<br />\"Sinister.\"<br />\"Egyptians?\"<br />\"Cowardly.\"<br />\"Oh? I thought you might have saved that for Italians.\"<br />\"No, no, they're greasy aren't they? Not as greasy as the French mind.\"<br />\"Germans?\"<br />\"Arrogant.\"<br />\"Spaniards?\"<br />\"Lazy.\"<br />\"Danes?\"<br />\"Pornographic.\"<br />\"Well that's just about everyone. Oh, Americans?\"<br />\"Well, they're flash aren't they?\"<br />\"So it's just down to the British is it?\"<br />\"Well, I haven't got much time for the Irish or the Welsh, and the Scots are<br />worse than the Koreans.\"<br />\"And you never could stand Southerners.\"<br />\"To tell you the truth I don't like anybody much outside this town. And there's<br />a lot of families in our street I can't stand either. Come to think of it I<br />don't even like the people next door.\"<br />\"I see, so from the distant blue Pacific through the barren wastes of Manchuria, to 127 Inkerman Terrace, you can't abide anyone.\"  </p></blockquote><p>England's batsmen have been found their form this Test and it's not down to something as simple as lucky pants or Graham Gooch's coaching according to John Woodberry: \"Not sure if this is relevant but I burnt a paper cricket bat at a Buddhist temple on tomb sweeping day here in Shanghai and two days later we started playing good cricket. Maybe we should all do this before each game?\" Is it cowardly to pray for the burning of paper cricket bats?</p><!-- Block 69 --><p><strong>57th over: Sri Lanka 139-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 20, Samaraweera 11)</strong> I've just been having a look to see which England bowlers have dismissed Mahela most in Tests. Andrew Flintoff took his wicket six times, Ashley Giles, Andy Caddick  and Matthew Hoggard three apiece, Jimmy Anderson and Graeme Swann twice each. Bresnan resumes with a decent line outside off-stump, looking to trap Samaraweera with the the one that then jags back on to his pads. Deb Chakrabartty offers this prediction: \"Sri Lanka 2nd innings 315 all out. England 2nd innings 97 all out. Sri Lanka win by 33runs.\" Dominic Cork reckons it'll all be over tonight. I'm not so sure. Maiden and a decent bouncer fifth ball.</p><!-- Block 70 --><p><strong>58th over: Sri Lanka 144-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 25, Samaraweera 11)</strong> Samit Patel with two slips in resumes and Mahela comes down the wicket to hit over mid on. He doesn't get the loft right and Tim Bresnan leaps and gets his fingertips to it but can't hang on. He's bowling quite flat, as he usually does, looking to keep it tight and get them taking risks to play attacking shots.</p><!-- Block 71 --><p><strong>59th over: Sri Lanka 146-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 26, Samaraweera 12)</strong> Nick Terdre has been thinking about Swann's philosophical consistency: \"Thinking of the dismissals or not of those such as Dilshan and Cook, according to the Graeme Swann's guide to etiquette at the wicket as expressed during one of the warm-up matches, a batsman should walk when he knows he's out. And to avoid any suggestion of double standards, Graeme must surely mean this stricture to apply as much to his team-mates as to the opposition. He appears to be out on a limb here - one or two, such as Gilchrist, are known for walking when they know they're out, but they are unfortunately the exception. It hasn't come to my notice that Swanny himself is proactive in this respect, but nor do I recall evidence to the contrary.\" Bresnan's bowling well, few signs of reverse, but alternating the ones that arc away and the ones that duck into the pads. Samaraweera is getting a good stride forward for his defensive shots and any sign of leg-side width is happy to tickle it around the corner.</p><!-- Block 72 --><p><strong>60th over: Sri Lanka 146-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 26, Samaraweera 12)</strong> I said this yesterday but Patel really rattles through his overs, trying never to allow the batsmen to settle between balls. What happens when he bowls to Trott in the championship, or used to? Who's tempo had to change?</p><!-- Block 73 --><p><strong>61st over: Sri Lanka 146-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 26, Samaraweera 12)</strong> Bresnan has a leg trap for Mahela with no slip but a short mid on, short leg  and short midwicket, probably a ruse to get him driving uppishly at the one that goes straight. Another maiden from Ponte Carlo's finest.</p><!-- Block 74 --><p><strong>62nd over: Sri Lanka 148-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 27, Samaraweera 13)</strong> Slow turn from Patel and Prior is greeting the odd one that pops off the surface with a theatrical groan. A pair of singles when his line strays either side of middle. Jo Davis is not impressed: \"Not getting Patel. Just looks like an old school English nothingrounder to me.\" Hmm. Thought he showed promise with the bat yesterday but is very much a fifth bowler. Perhaps in India he will be used as containment with his speared in deliveries. It's too early to judge whether he's going to make it in Tests.</p><!-- Block 75 --><p><strong>63rd over: Sri Lanka 152-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 31, Samaraweera 13)</strong> Low bounce off Bresnan's second ball that Prior takes with his knuckles scraping the ground. He goes wide of the crease next ball to target Mahela's body with a bouncer but it doesn't get up and the captain pivots and whacks it on the pull for four to the square leg boundary. He tries again with an off-cutter that goes close enough to the body to force Mahela into a backward defensive shot, then a slower ball. He's always trying something. Time for Swann at the other end.</p><!-- Block 76 --><p><strong>64th over: Sri Lanka 157-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 35, Samaraweera 14)</strong> Swann is bowling round the wicket to Jayawardene and gets one to grip on the surface on off-stump, as he did in the first innings, but Mahela's hands are quick enough to cope and kill the ball into the ground. The captain takes two off the last ball with some magnificent footwork, rocking back and punching it through the covers.</p><!-- Block 77 --><p><strong>65th over: Sri Lanka 157-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 35, Samaraweera 14)</strong> An email from Mike Jakeman with some give and take: \"Looking back at yesterday and I'm still reeling from that excellent innings from KP. Surely there can be no doubt that Test matches are the ultimate form of cricket, when a single innings can encompass the graft and patience from Strauss and Cook and then such savagery from KP. On that point, could I direct all OBOers to a book that I am trying to get published on the future of the Test? It's called Saving the Test, there's a <a href=\"http://www.savingthetest.tumblr.com\">website</a> (savingthetest.tumblr.com) and a twitter feed (@savingthetest). All I need is a publisher willing to put it on the shelves!\" Publisher? It's 2012. Ebooking it yourself seems to be the principal way these days. Good luck. Bresnan continues with his arsenal of bouncers, slower balls, induckers and conventional seam-up. Another maiden from him. Sri Lanka are 28 behind.</p><!-- Block 78 --><p><strong>66th over: Sri Lanka 159-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 36, Samaraweera 15)</strong> Prior keeps his chirpe up. I once played in a school match with a vocal wicketkeeper. \"Oi Noisy Norman, button it,\" said the umpire and he never said another word all match. A pair of singles off the over. I like England's patience today.</p><!-- Block 79 --><p><strong>67th over: Sri Lanka 164-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 36, Samaraweera 16)</strong> Attempted yorker from Bresnan swings in but is slightly underpitched and Samaraweera jabs his bat down in time then wristily whips a shorter one next ball off his legs for one. Sama's technique is underrated I think. He looks very solid and has an excellent temperament.</p><!-- Block 80 --><p><strong>68th over: Sri Lanka 172-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 41, Samaraweera 18)</strong> Samaraweera takes a single off the first ball with a steer to midwicket. With Galton and Simpson you got Hancock's Half Hour and Steptoe &amp; Son, both fine, but has anyone had such a varied, exemplary hat-trick as Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais with the Likely Lads, Porridge and Auf Pet? Mahela throws off the straitjacket with a belted, swept four. Great shot. \"My brother (who doesn't get cricket, the fool) says I have 'man-love' for KP,\" writes Dean Butler. \"Watching his innings yesterday was beautiful, when he bats like that he is the best in the world. Beautiful.\" Dean and KP sitting in a tree K\u2026I\u2026S\u2026S\u2026I\u2026N\u2026G.</p><!-- Block 81 --><p><strong>69th over: Sri Lanka 172-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 41, Samaraweera 18)</strong> Patel carries on, doing the spadework. Sri Lanka are 13 behind now. Slightly distracted that over by mass office whooping over the cycling.</p><!-- Block 82 --><p><strong>70th over: Sri Lanka 174-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 42, Samaraweera 20)</strong> Last over was Patel, not Swann as the office went Pendleton mad. Sorry. This is Swann and he has a big shout, Prior's arms at five to one and shrieking, mouth agtape for a good 10 seconds. It was drifting down the leg side. Big sweep from outside off from Mahela brings him one and though Samaraweera uses his feet daintily to get down the pitch to drive, he checks his shot and it rolls to mid off.</p><!-- Block 83 --><p><strong>71st over: Sri Lanka 176-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 43, Samaraweera 21)</strong> \"By the cycling?\" quips Tom Carver. \"It being Guardian Towers, should we take that to mean a new Brompton model is on sale?\" Very good. Imagine if Apple made a bike and wrote \"Twitter\" on the frame. We'd have to wade around Guardian Towers. Fifty partnership comes up as Mahela takes a sharp single off Patel.</p><!-- Block 84 --><p><strong>72nd over: Sri Lanka 180-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 44, Samaraweera 24)</strong> Swann is trying to turn the screw but Samaraweera is quick on his feet, fast to get up on his toes, to counter the spin. Then Swann tosses one up and the batsman is early on his shot but doesn't hit it with the power that would have brought the chance of a catch. He then takes two, coming down the track to tap it past mid-off. That's drinks.</p><!-- Block 85 --><p><strong>73rd over: Sri Lanka 182-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 45, Samaraweera 25)</strong> Morning James Debens: \"'Has anyone had such a varied, exemplary hat-trick as Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais with the Likely Lads, Porridge and Auf Pet?' Armando Iannucci - On the Hour, The Day Today, Knowing Me, Knowing You, I'm Alan Partridge, The Armando Iannucci Shows, The Thick of It, Time Trumpet. Enough said.\" Not bad, I suppose, if you like laughing. Eight overs till the new ball so they're persevering with Samit. Chris Drew asks: \"Is now the right time to say that we're missing Monty?\" RGD Willis beat you to it, Chris, at tea. Give the new ball 15 overs and I'll let you know.</p><!-- Block 86 --><p><strong>74th over: Sri Lanka 184-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 45, Samaraweera 25)</strong> Kevin Pietersen takes over from Graeme Swann, posibly with a view to him taking the new ball after six overs of seam. He starts with a big full toss outside off-stump that Samaraweera tonks into the covers for two. KP gives the next a big rip and it turns six inches and spits up off the pitch. Apart from the dross with the first ball, that was a good over, the ball jumping and spinning hard and the last ball catches Samaraweera's glove but the angle of his bat and grip when he played it meant it went into the ground short of Cook at short leg. batsman</p><!-- Block 87 --><p><strong>75th over: Sri Lanka 186-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 47, Samaraweera 27)</strong> Patel bowls a peach to Mahela, spinning and darting past the outside edge. Jaywardene steps back to turn the next to the gap in front of midwicket to level the scores and he and his partner run hard to take another pair of tip and run singles.</p><!-- Block 88 --><p><strong>76th over: Sri Lanka 199-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 50, Samaraweera 37)</strong> Samaraweera comes down the track to cream an off drive for four. England have never lost a Test with a lead as big as 185, which is preying on Ian Rubinstein's mind: \"Taking a leaf from the ghastly modernistic ODI commentary, what do you think would be a \"par\" target for the Sri Lankans to set here? Four-fer-effectively zip on the 4th day, would you call the game approximately level right now?\" England are still ahead, I'd say, but they need a quick wicket with the new ball. Sama then smashes another overpitched delivery for four then Mahela cuts a short, wide one to bring up his half-century.</p><!-- Block 89 --><p><strong>77th over: Sri Lanka 204-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 50, Samaraweera 42)</strong> That was a short break for Swann and first ball he spins it big and Samaraweera almost misjudges it completely, looking to cut, but adjusts in time to dead bat it into the ground. He then plays a glorious off-drive, head over the ball, big follow through, for four. What a stylish player he is.</p><!-- Block 90 --><p><strong>78th over: Sri Lanka 204-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 50, Samaraweera 42)</strong> Patel switches ends to have a dart from the Scoreboard End. Maiden as we're marking time before the call comes up for Jimmy to rescue England.</p><!-- Block 91 --><p><strong>79th over: Sri Lanka 205-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 51, Samaraweera 42)</strong> Swann's slow spin with the old ball is comfortably dealt with by Jayawardene. His method is so sound, plays late with the middle of the bat. Swann tries to counter with flight and changes of pace but with a ball this soft his best hope is a batting mistake and it doesn't look likely with these two at the crease. One off the over.</p><!-- Block 92 --><p><strong>80th over: Sri Lanka 206-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 52, Samaraweera 42)</strong> This should be the last over with this ball. Sri Lanka are 20 ahead at the start of the over. \"Right on it, fellas!\" cries Matt Prior. Phoney war over, now, I hope.</p><!-- Block 93 --><p><strong>81st over: Sri Lanka 208-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 53, Samaraweera 43)</strong> Anderson takes the new ball after a break of three and a half hours since his last bowl. He's got two slips in and his first ball is shortish and played off his hip by Mahela. He takes a single to point off the third ball when offered width. England have three fielders in ring in the covers and Samaraweera finds them with a forcing shot played away from his body, then steers the last ball to third man for a single.</p><!-- Block 94 --><p><strong>82nd over: Sri Lanka 209-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 53, Samaraweera 44)</strong> Steve Finn takes the new ball from the Scoreboard End. His height could be crucial, thinks Sir ITB. A varied comedy hat-trick from Mark Ramsden: \"Cricketer Dave Podmore, irascible writer Ed Reardon &amp; I an Actor \u2013 Christopher Douglas + various collaborators.\" Finn bowls a jaffa that leaves Samaraweera outside off-stump and the batsman attempts a nibble but doesn't catch a bite as it goes past his bat by a whisker. Finn's bowling fast from the start of his spell, 140kph or so, but a couple are  two feet wide of off-stump and wasted.</p><!-- Block 95 --><p><strong>83rd over: Sri Lanka 209-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 53, Samaraweera 44)</strong> Samaraweera has played a couple of false strokes to the new ball, the first an instinctive attempted flick off Finn, and now a cut to a wide long hop where his bat speed proved too wuick as the ball didn't get up as far as he'd expected. Anderson tempted him with one pitched up and Samaraweera opened his face and drove into the cover ring. The last ball leaps off the pitch rapidly, though, and Samaraweera definitely goes after it \u2026but misses with his attempted cut.</p><!-- Block 96 --><p><strong>84th over: Sri Lanka 211-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 55, Samaraweera 44)</strong> Mahela takes two when Finn delivers even though he knocked over the stumps with his back foot in his delivery stride which led to a loss of line. Finn comes wide of the crease to bowl across Jayawardene, looking for the Bruce Reid to David Gower legside tickle dismissal, but the batsman lifts his hands out of the way. Seven overs left and Sri Lankla are 26 ahead.</p><!-- Block 97 --><p><strong>85th over: Sri Lanka 212-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 55, Samaraweera 45)</strong> Jimmy's only on average about 5kph slower than Finn but his lack of inches compared to Finn means only the odd one (when the unevenness of the pitch lends a hand) gets up as high. Good line from Anderson and watchfully played. Give us a wicket, please.</p><!-- Block 98 --><p><strong>86th over: Sri Lanka 213-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 55, Samaraweera 45)</strong> I'm a big fan of Finn's followthrough. His momentum gets him right up to silly point some times. He's bowling well, decent length, and using the crease well. He goes wider with the fourth ball and traps Samaraweera on the top of his left pad and strangles an appeal. It was too high and would have missed leg stump. He arrows it across again next ball but it gets up even more and the square leg umpire signals a wide. It's a batsman's game. Sama digs out an off-stump yorker to finish the over.</p><!-- Block 99 --><p><strong>87th over: Sri Lanka 213-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 55, Samaraweera 45)</strong> Big off-cutter from Anderson starts the over and Guy the Gorilla and Athers argue about whether Mahela played a shot or not as it sailed by. Athers thinks not. The pitch is up to its tricks as Jayawardene has to dig out one that flew low. Good over, maiden.</p><!-- Block 100 --><p><strong>88th over: Sri Lanka 215-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 55, Samaraweera 47)</strong> The substitute Ravi Bopara makes an excellent diving stop at cover off the first ball when Samaraweera slaps a drive off a wide one. What a formidably resilient side Sri Lanka are, writes he \u2013 hoping for a Jonah effect. That's unfair, they have batted superbly this pair.  They're 30 ahead with six wickets left and three overs left in the day. Chuck Swann on.</p><!-- Block 101 --><p><strong>89th over: Sri Lanka 215-4 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 55, Samaraweera 47)</strong> It's Anderson again, bending his back as usual, bowling really well, short of a length the ball crashing heavily into the bat. Mahela's judgment is top notch, leaving anything short and jagging back at him. But the last ball of the over is another jaffa, fuller length and bringing Jayawardene forward and missing his outside edge only by an inch or so.</p><!-- Block 102 --><p><strong>WICKET!! Samaraweera b Swann 47</strong> A huge turner from Swann, Samaraweera rocked back and played on off the middle of his bat. Swann strikes again in the first over of a spell.</p><!-- Block 103 --><p><strong>WICKET!! Randiv b Swann 0</strong> The nightwatchman goes, bowled through the gate with one that ripped and gripped.</p><!-- Block 104 --><p><strong>90th over: Sri Lanka 216-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 55, Mathews 1)</strong> Two wickets in Swann's first three balls \u2013 rip, grip and, crucially, dip. Samaraweera had played so judiciously but was too aggressive to Swann's big spinning first ball. Mathews gets forward to the last three balls and takes the single off the sixth with a squirt to third man.</p><!-- Block 105 --><p><strong>91st over: Sri Lanka 218-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  M Jayawardene 55, Mathews 3)</strong> Anderson to bowl the last over and he has his dander up, dragging his hand down the side of the ball and forcing Mathews to square up and play it into the off side with an angled bat while his body erred to the onside. He gets fully behind the next two shortish ones and turns a wayward fourth off his toes to midwicket for two. Mathews plays and misses the fine fifth ball which zips away and blocks the last. Sri Lanka are 33 ahead with four wickets left and a day to play. Thanks for all your emails. Please join Rob Smyth tomorrow morning and if it goes on long enough I might get the call off the football bench to help.

        "body":"<p>You might expect a studio with films of the quality of Up, Wall-E, Ratatouille and Toy Story 3 to be excused for making the odd turkey, yet there are still those who haven't forgiven Pixar for churning out the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jul/21/cars-2-review\" title=\"\">distinctly average Cars 2</a> last year. They're the studio that are often seen as the antidote to bland Hollywood commercialism, so Cars 2's vapidity stuck in the craw of critics almost as much as the sudden availability of entire fleets of branded merchandise. The good news is that the Emeryville-based production company's latest offering, Brave, has the feel of a stout-hearted return to form, one that doesn't look like a strong candidate for a cynical marketing drive.</p><p>On paper, the movie appears an easy target for cynics. It began life under a different director, Brenda Chapman, and with a different title, The Bear and the Bow. It will arrive in July almost two years after the release of rival Dreamworks' <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/135028/how-to-train-your-dragon-3d\" title=\"\">How to Train Your Dragon</a>, which also featured a largely Scottish cast of rambunctious bruisers and a young hero who did not quite fit in. Brave is Pixar's first fairytale, previously the preserve of the more traditional, less daring Disney (which bought Pixar in 2006). It even has a tough female protagonist known for her skill with a bow and arrow, echoing the plot of this year's biggest blockbuster <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/142857/hunger-games\" title=\"\">The Hunger Games</a>. And yet from a few minutes into the half hour of preview footage journalists were shown in central London last month, it became clear that Brave is its own beast.</p><p>It offers a delightfully modern, feminist twist on the traditional fairytale princess narrative. Not only is Merida, voiced by Kelly MacDonald, unimpressed by the three suitors sent to battle for her hand in marriage, she's quite capable of knocking all of them on their backsides. Her father King Fergus (voiced by Billy Connolly) is an enormous boisterous man-child with a peg-leg, rather than the bland, majestic figure one might expect from a Disney confection. It is left to the more statesmanlike queen (Emma Thompson) to make her feisty red-headed daughter aware of her duties \u2013 the entire kingdom is likely to go up in flames if Merida isn't married \u2013 though one gets the impression that Fergus would probably be quite up for the ruck. There is a wonderful back story to that missing leg, by the way: the monarch once fought it out with a demon-like bear king who chomped off his limb and swallowed it whole. When Merida winds up in a murky and mysterious forest after a row with mum, we suspect she may end up bumping into the hideous beast.</p><p> Brave is beautiful to look at \u2013 a moving tapestry of pastel curlicues and opaque textures which stand in stark contrast to the sharp, clean lines seen in Cars or <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/34576/toy-story-in-3d\">Toy Story</a>. The film's look most closely resembles that of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/119669/ratatouille\">Ratatouille</a>, but the colour palette is very different: all blues and greens reflecting the fantasy Scots highland background rather than the urban browns, yellows and oranges of Pixar's take on Paris. Somewhere in northern California I imagine there is an animator whose entire year was spent learning how to billow and tumble Merida's gloriously animate tressles in just the right manner: Pixar boss John Lasseter ought to give them a Christmas bonus.</p><p>Brave is the first Pixar movie to be set entirely in the British isles, and there was a sizeable contingent of Scots down in London for last month's preview. They are getting very excited indeed about a film that features an almost exclusively Scottish cast, including Craig Ferguson, Robbie Coltrane and Kevin McKidd as the three rival clan leaders whose sons compete for Merida's hand. The production team have done an honourable job of giving the movie an authentic Celtic feel: director Mark Andrews told us after the screening that the Pixar crew visited a highland games, drank Scotch whisky and went skinny dipping in lochs to pick up a flavour of the local sensibilities. They also watched films like Braveheart, Local Hero and Dear Frankie to analyse how Scots speak. </p><p>\"When people speak in a Scottish accent, it comes very specifically out of the mouth,\" said Andrews. \"There were some moments recording with Billy, Craig and Robbie when we had to say to slow it down a little. We'd say: 'Let's do it again for middle America,' and they were all fine because at the end of the day, it has to be clear and understandable. But for Kevin, who does both voices of the Lord and the Young MacGuffin, he talks in the Doric dialect from his area. He'd call up his mum to get her to remind him about certain words and accents, and we've left some of it unintelligible because that is the gag.\" </p><p>Andrews seemed a little disappointed when one journalist pointed out that Merida's mischievous triplet brothers are named Hamish, Harris and <em>Hubert</em>, the latter carrying a suspiciously Anglo-Saxon twang, but you cannae win 'em all.</p><p>There will be no real compromises for the film in US cinemas then. That rather suits Brave. Pixar's latest feels like a return to movies built on courage, not compromise.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/film&k=Pixar&k=Animation&k=Film&k=Fairytales&k=Emma+Thompson&k=Billy+Connolly\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/film/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/film/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Pixar+takes+a+Brave+step+with+a+feisty+fairytale+Article+1728026&ch=Film&c2=148491&c4=Pixar%2CAnimation+%28Film+genre%29%2CFilm%2CFairytales%2CEmma+Thompson%2CBilly+Connolly&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ben+Child&c7=12-Apr-06&c8=1728026&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: film/filmblog/2012/apr/06/pixar-brave-feisty-fairytale|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|bac0ae205d7b109a49d9d2b11085097306cc5f8f -->",

        "body":"<!-- Block 1 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.30am:</span> Mitt Romney's campaign isn't letting up the pressure on his Republican rivals, in an effort to bring the GOP nomination battle to a close and finally focus on taking on President Obama in November.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rick Santorum's campaign is searching for a new strategy to contain Romney's lead, with a meeting of supporters contemplating how and if their candidate can compete.</p><p>Here's a summary of the latest news from <strong>Ryan Devereaux</strong>:</p><blockquote><p>\u2022 A new poll finds Mitt Romney has the advantage over Rick Santorum in the latter's home state of Pennsylvania, which is holding its primary at the end of the month. According to <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/04/romney-takes-the-lead-in-pennsylvania.html\">Public Policy Polling</a>, Romney enjoys a 42% to 37% lead over Santorum. Meanwhile Texas congressman Ron Paul has 9% and Newt Gingrich has 6%. Romeny's lead marks a significant 17-point turn around from 25% just one month ago.</p><p>\u2022 Romney is also polling well in New York. According to the latest Quinnipiac poll, Romney is dominating Santorum 54% to 21% among likely Republican primary voters in New York State. New York is holding its primary on the same day as Pennsylvania, April 24, and has 95 delegates up for grabs.</p><p>\u2022 The Texas Tribune revealed that Romney has received the endorsement of the three of the state's congressmen, one of whom, Pete Sessions, is the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Along with representatives John Carter and Mac Thornberry, Sessions joins House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Whip Kevin McCarthy and a number of GOP committee chairs in supporting Romney.</p><p>\u2022 As his prospects dwindle, Rick Santorum has revived a four-year old  controversy in an attempt to stay relevant. Addressing voters in Pennsylvania yesterday \u2013 the state with the largest National Rifle Association population in the nation \u2013 Santorum said \"you're damn right\" Pennsylvanians cling to guns and religion \u2013 a reference to observations by Barack Obama in 2008 on \"bitter\" working class Americans.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 2 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.47am:</span> More detail within the <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/04/romney-takes-the-lead-in-pennsylvania.html\">PPP poll from Pennsylvania</a>, the one showing Mitt Romney in the lead in Rick Santorum's home state.</p><p>PPP's analysis is that \"Pennsylvania Republicans are expressing major doubts about Santorum's viability,\" based on:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Romney's made huge in roads with the groups that have tended to fuel Santorum's success. What was a 37 point lead for Santorum with Evangelicals is now only 10 points at 44-34. What was a 32 point advantage for him with Tea Party voters is now only 6 at 41-35. And in the greatest sign that conservatives are starting to really around Romney a little bit, what was a 51 point deficit for him with 'very conservative' voters is now only 11 points at 44-33.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.01am:</span> The chairman of the Republican national committee says there is no Republican \"war on women\". Or, here's precisely how Reince Priebus (yes, that is his real name) <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-05/priebus-says-gender-battle-as-fictonal-as-caterpillar-war\">put it in an interview</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>If the Democrats said we had a war on caterpillars and every mainstream media outlet talked about the fact that Republicans have a war on caterpillars, then we'd have problems with caterpillars. It's a fiction.</p></blockquote><p>OK: so we know that Priebus wasn't comparing women to caterpillars. Unless he's really, really stupid. As opposed to just stupid, as this quote suggests.</p><p>Do we need to point out that caterpillars can't vote \u2013 and so this isn't really a very apt act of hyperbole? No, we don't.</p><p>Hats off to Business Week for this <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-05/priebus-says-gender-battle-as-fictonal-as-caterpillar-war\">excellent headline</a>: \"Priebus Says Gender Battle as Fictional as Caterpillar War\".</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.17am:</span> Remember Michele Bachmann?

Yet in modern times they almost never choose a running mate based on the assumption that he or she can swing a state with a lot of electoral votes. The running mate often comes from a state with few electoral votes and/or a safe state and, when he or she has recently come from a state rich in electoral votes, that fact has played little, if any, role in the selection.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.51am:</span> From the exciting world of <strong>political Tumblr photoshopping</strong> comes this delight:</p><p>The Anthony Weiner one is particularly good.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.07pm:</span> Details of the secret meeting held this morning between a group of conservatives and <strong>Rick Santorum</strong> are starting to leak out.</p><p>Apparently the point of the meeting was to consider how to push Newt Gingrich out of the Republican presidential race.

Or maybe just not enough time actually working in the real world.</p></blockquote><p>Yes, well, except that Mitt himself has two degrees from Harvard and in fact spent more time studying there than Obama. This is a common weakness of the Romney campaign's line of attacks: they could plausibly work, except that Romney himself isn't a credible messenger for them.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.40pm:</span> <strong>Mark Sanford</strong>, the former governor of South Carolina and an almost certain 2012 presidential candidate until that unfortunate business with the Argentine lover and the going Awol and the wacky press conference, isn't buying the \"it's all over, Romney won\" stuff.</p><p>Instead, <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2012/04/04/wisconsin-primary-win-not-tipping-point-for-romney-campaign/\">he argues that Rick Santorum is crazy like a fox</a>, and says we should all \"grab the binoculars and watch Pennsylvania\":</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>If there is anything close to a tipping point in the Santorum campaign, this will be it.

She <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/embarrass-the-future/\">writes in the NYT's comment site</a> that associate justice Anthony Kennedy and chief justice John Roberts seemed to be leaning in the government's direction:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Justice Kennedy, suggesting that \"most questions in life are matters of degree\" \u2013 as opposed to the plaintiffs' all-or-nothing position \u2013 seemed to endorse the government's argument that the market for health care has unique features that separate it from the various hypotheticals and analogies buzzing around the courtroom.</p></blockquote><p>This cartoon \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/cartoons/2012/April/Vegetable-Tale.aspx\">If buying broccoli were like buying health insurance</a>\" \u2013 makes Kennedy's point perfectly.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">3.26pm:</span> The disgraceful fact that the Augusta National golf club, home of the Masters tournament, doesn't admit women as members, got political today.</p><p>First off, White House press secretary <strong>Jay Carney</strong> said that President Obama's \"personal opinion is that women should be admitted\" to the club.</p><p>Even <strong>Mitt Romney</strong> agreed, when he was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/EmilyABC/status/187983844497035264\">asked this afternoon</a>, while campaigning in Pennsylvania:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>If I could run Augusta, which isn't likely to happen, but of course I'd have women in Augusta.

That needs a net gain of at least 92,000 per month \u2013 including tomorrow's jobs figures for March. Yes, that's certainly do-able.</p><p><strong>Update</strong>: Whoops. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/justinwolfers/status/188030808332832768\">Wolfers corrects his earlier tweet</a> to point out that private payrolls fell by 646,000 during George Bush's two terms in office. So that means Obama is already well ahead.</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.02pm:</span> Today's top-secret strategy meeting of conservative <strong>Santorum supporters</strong> doesn't appear to have achieved anything so far. <a href=\"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/05/11039940-santorum-conservative-leaders-focus-on-getting-gingrich-out-of-race\">MSNBC has the details</a>:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>The Gingrich campaign confirmed to NBC's Alex Moe that Santorum and Gingrich had met over the last couple of weeks, but, stressed that there is no chance Gingrich will exit the race and encourage his delegates to vote for Santorum.</p><p>Santorum \"should have thought about that during the primaries,\" Gingrich spokesman RC Hammond told Moe, \"and Newt is not dropping out and handing him our delegates.\"</p><p>He added, \"Newt has not agreed to any alliances, and he is going to continue to move forward with his candidacy, and it is Senator Santorum's decision alone if he wants to continue his candidacy.\"</p><p>There was no discussion \u2013 or encouragement \u2013 at the meeting today of Santorum to drop out, the source said. And talk of Santorum rethinking before Pennsylvania is silly, [a source close to the Santorum campaign] said.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 17 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">4.45pm:</span> The only excitement following Washington DC's primaries on Tuesday came from post-election comments made by Marion Barry, the former mayor who remains a city councillor.</p><p>Barry easily won re-election in DC's south-east Ward 8 but then was <a href=\"http://www.nbcwashington.com/video/#!/news/local/Barry-Decries-Too-Many-Asian-Stores/146180605\">caught at his election victory party on camera</a> saying:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>We've got to do something about these Asians coming in, opening up businesses, those dirty shops.

        "body":"<p>Nine years ago, Jim Moray startled the folk scene by treating the well-worn Early One Morning to a barrage of electric guitar and programming. Since then he has moved towards a more traditional acoustic approach, while developing his skills as versatile singer, player and producer, and retaining the ability to surprise. The cover photo of his fifth album shows him cuddling a fox, an image that's as distinctively English but unexpected, as is his treatment of (mostly) traditional songs, starting with the brutal story of The Captain's Apprentice, in which Moray's edgy piano work is backed by sax and double bass. Elsewhere he plays anything from guitars and banjo to drums, keyboards and melodeon, and he's joined by Andy Cutting on accordion and BJ Cole on pedal steel for the finest track, a soulful treatment of that classic ballad of love and death, Lord Douglas. There are just two contemporary songs: Anais Mitchell's pained If It's True, and a gutsy, banjo and harmonica-backed version of Fleetwod Mac's Big Love, now sounding as sturdy as a great folk song.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/music&k=Folk+music&k=Music&k=Culture\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Jim+Moray%3A+Skulk+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1727776&ch=Music&c2=148491&c4=Folk+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Robin+Denselow&c7=12-Apr-05&c8=1727776&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2012/apr/05/jim-moray-skulk-review|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|29d89dacca13450b4ead91b1ecc862e240034f4a -->",

        "headline":"How Scotland Yard's racism allegations unfolded",
        "body":"<p>The police van, filled with eight officers, pulled up beside the black Citroën, on the corner of a residential street in east London, at around 6pm. It should have been a routine stop and search, one of hundreds taking place on 11 August as police tried to keep the streets quiet after three nights of intense rioting.</p><p>Instead, the events that were about to unfold on the street, and later in nearby Forest Gate police station, would, eight months on, plunge Scotland Yard into a race controversy and ignite a public debate on how police treat young black men.</p><p>At least two Newham borough officers in the van parked on Routh Street, in Beckton, are now suspected of involvement in serious assaults on two young black men, in separate incidents that same night.</p><p>One, 21-year-old Mauro Demetrio, used his mobile phone to record an officer racially abusing him and said he was \"strangled\" in the police van. The other, Terelle Ferguson, 15 at the time, alleges he was strangled, as well as kicked, dragged across the floor and kneed in the back, and suffers a long-term injury.</p><p>The vexed question of race allegedly played out in different but disturbing ways in two cases. Demetrio's recording captures one of the officers, PC Alex MacFarlane, subject him to a series of racial insults, at one point telling him: \"The problem with you is you will always be a nigger.\"</p><p>Ferguson said that when he complained to MacFarlane about the way he was being treated, the officer said: \"You're just being racist, little boy. You're being racist.\"</p><p>This week, the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that two urgent reviews were underway into advice it gave over the prospects of prosecuting police officers allegedly implicated in both cases.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/03/met-police-commissioner-report-racist-behaviour\" title=\"\">urged all 48,000 staff</a> in the force to report inappropriate behaviour, warning: \"I will not stand for any racism or racists in the Met.\"</p><p>Within a day, three other policemen in east London had been placed on restricted duties for allegedly making racist comments between January and March in a separate incident. On Thursday night a further five cases were referred to the police watchdog.</p><p>The story starts just after the riots in the summer of 2011. Shortly after seeing the van containing eight officers, Demetrio said he pulled over to the side of the road. He describes seeing police rushing toward his car. \"They seemed twitchy because of the riots,\" he said. \"There were a lot of police cars in the area at that time and the officers seemed fired up.\"</p><p>Demetrio was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of drugs \u2013 an accusation later dropped \u2013 and handcuffed and placed in the back of the van. He alleges that, while inside the vehicle and surrounded by other officers, he was assaulted, his head pushed against the van window. He says an officer put his knees on his chest and began strangling him. Shortly after Demetrio turned on the voice recorder on his mobile phone. He managed to make two recordings, lasting in all about 12 minutes. They give a few verbal exchanges between Demetrio and the officers over several minutes and are interspersed with long silences and the crackling sound of police radios.</p><p>Demetrio occasionally raises his voice to complain about his treatment, and insults the officers. Asked to explain why he \"strangled\" Demetrio, an officer replies \"cos you're a cunt\", adding that he was \"kicking out\". The officer adds: \"Stopped you though, didn't it?\"</p><p>Minutes later MacFarlane begins abusing Demetrio, using the offensive racist slur. Angered, Demetrio reads out MacFarlane's badge number (KF05) and complains that he had subjected him to racist comments: \"I'll always be a nigger \u2013 that's what you said, yeah?\"</p><p>MacFarlane replies: \"You'll always have black skin colour. Don't hide behind your colour, yeah.\" He adds: \"Be proud. Be proud of who you are, yeah. Don't hide behind your black skin.\"</p><p>The excerpts <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/30/police-racism-black-man-abuse\" title=\"\">released by the Guardian last week</a> have been listened to hundreds of thousands of times and prompted public outrage. Amid the public furore over the recording questions have been raised about why the other officers in the van did not report their colleague racially abusing Demetrio. The Guardian understands that when investigators questioned the seven other officers in the van about the incident  they all claimed not to have heard MacFarlane make racist remarks.</p><p>The Met says it cannot comment on the details: \"This matter is the subject of an independent IPCC investigation and it would be inappropriate to discuss any alleged details prior to their investigation being completed,\" said a spokesman on Thursday yesterday.</p><p>Hogan-Howe, however, clearly believes the case raises important questions about accountability. \"We have a duty to challenge or report any behaviour by colleagues which is less than the high standard demanded by the service and Londoners themselves,\" he said in his address to staff. \"You cannot avoid that duty. Nor can I.\"</p><p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which investigated Demetrio's case, referred the matter to the CPS in January, after concluding that three officers may have co mmitted criminal offences. They were MacFarlane, identified as the officer making the racist remarks, and two others suspected of involvement in the alleged assault on Demetrio in the van: PC Joe Harrington and a constable known as Officer C.</p><p>The CPS initially decided not to bring charges against any of the officers. Senior lawyers at the CPS are now reviewing the case and MacFarlane has been suspended.</p><p>The paths of Demetrio and Ferguson crossed in the caged cell adjacent to the custody section of Forest Gate police station. The two had never met before. Demetrio had just arrived at the police station after the alleged assault in the van. He later handed in his mobile phone to custody desk officers and pleaded with them to investigate his treatment by Harrington and MacFarlane.</p><p>Demetrio claimed he saw Harrington allegedly assault Ferguson, a 15-year-old from east London. Demetrio later told investigators he saw Harrington kick the teenager in the back of the leg and, once he was on the floor, knee him in the back.</p><p>Ferguson had been transferred to Forest Gate from a police station in Stratford, east London, where he was arrested earlier in the day after being asked to attend the police station. The matter for which he was wanted has since been dropped.</p><p>Ferguson, now 16, this week provided the Guardian with a detailed account of his complaint against the police. He says he saw Demetrio brought into the caged area in handcuffs: \"He looked quiet. Reserved. Something was up.\"</p><p>Ferguson claims he recognised Harrington as a police officer who had strangled him during a stop and search incident two days earlier, though Harrington says he had had no contact with him then.</p><p>Harrington's lawyers also point out that he is currently not charged with anything. \"PC Harrington has been advised that he is not to be the subject of any criminal proceedings in relation to allegations made concerning events in the custody area on the 11 August 2011,\" they said in a statement.</p><p>MacFarlane's lawyers said: \"PC MacFarlane was advised by IPCC investigators on the 20 December 2011 that he was not regarded as a suspect in relation to allegations made by the 15-year-old youth, but in fact was being treated as a witness. He has, therefore, never been interviewed under criminal caution in relation to any allegation made by this individual. We consider it inappropriate at the present time to comment further in relation to the complaints made by Mr Demetrio.\"</p><p>Days after the alleged assault, Ferguson lodged an complaint with the IPCC. The police watchdog initially supervised a Met police inquiry into Ferguson's complaint; CCTV was obtained, although it is believed to have captured only part of the alleged assault.</p><p>At an early stage investigators consulted the CPS about Ferguson's case, and prosecutors advised there was no realistic prospect of convicting Harrington for common assault.</p><p>Then in October, when investigators realised that Ferguson and Demetrio's cases were connected, the IPCC upgraded the inquiry to an independent investigation. That inquiry has been completed and was submitted to the Met on Tuesday.</p><p>The report is understood to deal mainly with the actions of Harrington and to recommend that the officer, who is currently on restricted duties, is disciplined.</p><p>However, there remains a possibility that Harrington will be prosecuted over the alleged assault on Ferguson.</p><p>The Crown Prosecution Service announced an urgent review into the cases, and is reconsidering the advice it gave over the prospects for bringing a criminal charge against Harrington. The CPS said a senior lawyer was now reviewing the case, including evidence that was not available the first time around.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Metropolitan+police&k=Race+issues&k=London&k=Police&k=UK+news&k=World+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=How+Scotland+Yard%27s+racism+allegations+unfolded+Article+1728107&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=Metropolitan+police%2CRace+issues+%28News%29%2CLondon+%28News%29%2CPolice+and+policing%2CUK+news%2CWorld+news&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Paul+Lewis&c7=12-Apr-05&c8=1728107&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/05/scotland-yard-allegations-of-racism|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|1a112df2e69acc25096cdcf0006c0e0d86967be2 -->",

        "body":"<p>There is no crackle on the line to Glenn Close. No echo or delay. No hiss or interference. \"Yes! I can hear you! I can hear you fine!\" She sounds almost alarmingly near, sat in her flat on Central Park West, New York. Not boomy, exactly, but big on crisp diction (it was she they called to dub Andie MacDowell's duff twangs on Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes). \"It's a little bit of a chilly day here, but all the blossoms are out, all the trees are blooming. It's raining there? Oh dear.\"</p><p>Close is all about the good connection. On <a href=\"http://www.fetchdog.com/blogs/livelylicks/\" title=\"\">Lively Licks</a>, the dog blog she co-authors with her terriers Jake and Bill (they share the byline), along with the <a href=\"http://www.fetchdog.com/blogs/livelylicks/QandA/q_a_with_lauren_bacall\" title=\"\">celebrity Q&amp;As</a>, and the serious reads on <a href=\"http://www.fetchdog.com/blogs/livelylicks/General/beautiful_new_book_puppies_behind\" title=\"\">Puppies Behind Bars</a>, Close herself offers counsel to concerned mutt-lovers. \"Betty Wigglesworth must continue to sleep with you, especially now that she is getting older,\" <a href=\"http://www.fetchdog.com/blogs/livelylicks/General/your_licks_glenn_close_responds2\" title=\"\">she advises one</a>. <a href=\"http://www.fetchdog.com/blogs/livelylicks/General/glenn_close_responds_on_cleaning\" title=\"\">To another</a>: \"The important thing to remember when cleaning up an accident is to use&nbsp;a cleaning product that removes all&nbsp;the odour.\"</p><p>Close opens up (there's candid <a href=\"http://www.fetchdog.com/blogs/livelylicks/QandA/q_a_with_glenn_close\" title=\"\">snaps</a>, shaggy <a href=\"http://www.fetchdog.com/blogs/livelylicks/General/random_licks_glenn_close_on\" title=\"\">stories</a>) and she reaches out. \"Thanks for asking,\" <a href=\"http://www.fetchdog.com/blogs/livelylicks/General/your_licks_glenn_close_responds1\" title=\"\">she tells a reader </a>who inquires as to Jake and Bill's favourite toy (squeaky monkey). \"Thanks for writing\" is <a href=\"http://www.fetchdog.com/blogs/livelylicks/General/glenn_close_responds_on_dealing\" title=\"\">her sign-off</a> to Barbara, whose moult woes might, she thinks, be alleviated by a \"fantastic de-shedding tool\" called the&nbsp;Furminator.</p><p>\"People desperately need connection. There's a danger now of getting further and further away from two human eyes looking into two human eyes. The thing that I love is that we have evolved to be empathetic. We have these neurons called mirror neurons, which reflect what you see in&nbsp;other people's faces. But now people think communication is texting and tweeting. On TV, too, you see something horrific on the news and then you go to an ad and then to something else and it becomes this amorphous jangle.\"</p><p>She laughs abruptly, then continues. \"It's an emotional disconnect. Movies are so powerful because you get this big screen with a closeup and you basically are being connected to another human being. It's as powerful as looking into a live human face. And that's something shared with no other artform.\"</p><p>Her new film flirts with withheld eye-contact. It teases the audience with a lead whose extreme self-effacement presents something of an empathy test. \"The biggest challenge for me was: how much do you show in&nbsp;her face? Because she's so used to having nothing there.\"</p><p>Albert Nobbs is based on an 1895 novella by George Moore, via a 1982 stage production in which Close also starred. It's the story of a taciturn butler in a Dublin hotel who just happens to be \u2013 not really a spoiler, this \u2013 a woman. Albert's cover is blown when a flea invades her corset the one night she is forced to share digs with a strapping decorator, Hubert. But as luck would have it, Hubert, too, turns out to have a feminine secret \u2013 Janet McTeer's bosomy reveal, puffing proudly on a cig, has picked up something of a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/GuyLodge/statuses/152828488930435072\" title=\"\">niche following</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>Once content melting into the wallpaper and squirreling shillings beneath the floorboards, Albert is inspired to try to replicate Hubert's domestic setup, complete with seaside cottage and even a wife. Problem is, Albert is a naïf, an orphan who went into disguise at 14 partly to fend off further sexual assault, partly to find work. Her pursuit of Mia Wasikowska's perky housemaid (herself smitten with Aaron Johnson's boiler boy) looks unlikely to pan out as planned. Typical date chat: \"I think you are the strangest man I ever met.\"</p><p>The film, too, is one of the weirdest in recent mainstream memory. Stick with it, and you will be deeply moved: the cumulative power of a chamber piece that grips harder than you'd expect, that's sly when it could be sledgehammerish, funny when it might be forlorn (it goes without saying the acting is impeccable). Yet it's far from an easy sell. \"Dear Jesus, I don't know what makes people live such miserable lives,\" says Brendan Gleeson's alcoholic doctor near the end \u2013 dialogue that would serve well as a tagline. Tonally, too, it has a singular taste: half Upstairs Downstairs, half Boys Don't Cry, but funny with it; a sort of Downton Tootsie.</p><p>\"I can see why people might find it frustrating. I've had critics say: 'Oh, it's so sad and Albert is so buttoned-up it's hard to feel for him.' Well, that's fine if that's the way people read it,\" Close says with a hint of bristle, \"but I know there are people like that in the world; a lot of invisible, isolated people. And I&nbsp;think they deserve to have their stories told.</p><p>\"Everybody isn't triumphant in their life. We should be aware of that; and know that as bad as your life may seem on any given day, someone else is struggling with something much more difficult. Of course in the entertainment world we love heroes and we love villains, we love a lot of action and we love a lot of sex, but I do think there is room for stories of people like Albert. It's about paying attention to somebody who is difficult at times to figure out. But attention should be paid.\"</p><p>Close has been here before, wrangling artistic purity and punters' desires. Twenty-five years ago she fought hard against a reshoot of Fatal Attraction's finale, in which her bunny-boiling book editor was throttled in the bath by ex-lover Michael Douglas, then shot in the heart by his wife. The scrapped version \u2013 Close slits her throat but frames Douglas for the crime \u2013 was more psychologically sound, but deemed a bit of a downer by test&nbsp;audiences.</p><p>\"I learned through that process that catharsis is very important,\" she says. In Albert Nobbs \u2013 on which she also served as writer and producer \u2013 the generally tragic effect is leavened with a semi-sunny epilogue. By and large, though, she thinks people might benefit from a mosey up the hard road. \"The big pop films spell out everything. People get lazy, I think And I think that's not necessarily a good thing.\"</p><p>There's an inevitable price to pay at the box office. For a triple Oscar-nominated picture (Close, McTeer, makeup), Albert Nobbs has not had audiences queueing round the block in the US. You fear that might be tough for Close, whose involvement has been intense and personal, a dream of 29 years, ever since she played the part on stage (she even wrote the theme tune). But no: \"Everybody said you're going to feel so down, you're going to feel post-partum depression, and I never felt that. I actually felt very fulfilled by the whole&nbsp;experience.\"</p><p>Perhaps Close, as an actor, is not much fuelled by conventional acceptance. Midway through her audition for the stage role in 1982, she broke off and said: \"I'm boring myself so I must be boring you. I think I'm going to go home.\" She did; but the producers hauled her back the next day and gave her the part.</p><p>Maybe what they saw was an unusual abashment, which Close \u2013 for all her professional steel \u2013 seems to share with the character. It's telling that her big passion project is not one dripping with showreel moments. That sixth consecutive Oscar defeat may have stung more than she has let on, but there's no way such a subtle turn stood a chance against the showboat delivered by Meryl Streep in The Iron&nbsp;Lady.</p><p>Streep is the crucial counterpoint to Close's career. \"I've often been mistaken for Meryl,\" she once said, \"although never on Oscar night.\" They share the same angular blonde chops, the same generation (Close, at 65, is a couple of years the senior), the same theatre pedigree, the same east coast upbringing. There's even a slight slippage between their roles: Streep's lead in The Devil Wears Prada took cues from Close's fashionista Cruella De Vil, just as Close's ruthless lawyer on TV show Damages completes the circle with another tough boss. Yet Streep is somehow perceived as the more easily lovable star; once an uncomplicated pinup, now an aspirational dame. Close's appeal is slippier. \"I don't have the face or body for romcoms,\" she <a href=\"http://www.pressherald.com/life/audience/talking-glenn-close_2012-02-26.html\" title=\"\">said earlier this year</a> \u2013 though her two breakthrough roles, in The World According to Garp and The Big Chill, were wholesome enough. Yet it was he double-bill of bitches in Fatal Attraction and Dangerous Liaisons that cemented the reputation. Even before Albert Nobbs, her best performances teetered towards drag, riffed on her strong jaw and ballsy gaze (her Damages character is called \"a real hard-dick bitch\" in the pilot). Yet even when they're panto, they're never quite camp. While Streep embraces the wink and the nudge, Close goes full-throttle on the integrity, with no space for spin.</p><p>Analysis is her way in: the first thing she did after landing the Fatal Attraction part was to send the script to two psychiatrists. Albert's problem, she thinks, is similar to her character's in that film: she hadn't processed being sexually abused as a child. Close likes identifying the trigger: \"When I played Blanche Dubois on stage, I thought: this person has classic post-traumatic stress disorder from seeing her lover blow his head off in front of her.\"</p><p>Has she ever experienced equivalent stress? It's impossible to know. Close is warm enough on the phone, but she has never opened up about what are obliquely referred to as her \"dark days\", when she toured Vietnam military bases with <a href=\"http://goldendome.org/music/UpWithPeople/index.htm\" title=\"\">Up With People</a>, a Moral Re-Armament-supporting folk group, whose guitarist she married. They split after five years; Close enrolled at drama school, and has been&nbsp;a Democrat ever since.</p><p>Nonetheless, she does believe that trauma can make a person. \"I've read about and met people who've had horrendous childhoods and they're the most enlightened people. They have a certain kind of soul. With Albert, she didn't want to be discovered and so she's not angry or confrontational, she's just shut a part of herself down. It wasn't like she had huge expectations for her life. I think what every human being seeks is safety and connection. Albert has this vision of two chairs and a warm comforting fire, and that is her dream. And what I learned to articulate about the story is that there isn't any such thing as small dreams. To someone like Albert, to have a sitting room with a store downstairs, that's as big as somebody saying: I want to be president of the United States.\"</p><p>She must ring off now, her own dream of three decades over. Waking life awaits.</p><p><em>\u2022 Albert Nobbs opens in the UK on 27 April.</em></p><p>\u2022 This article was amended on Friday 6 April 2012.

Neither is the inspirational midwest ever far away. Before the band play, a prologue \u2013 projected on to the brick wall behind them \u2013 describes \"a high, treeless continent, without rivers, without streams\", before the landscape comes roaring to life with the jubilant chords of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJvAPp-paFk\" title=\"\">As I Lay My Head Down</a>.

Gems like Dust Bowl III and Weather recall the emotive sincerity of the Verve; there's vivid hues of both Calexico and John Barry in the noirish Americana of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCEIc8vJ4Bs\" title=\"\">Old Statues</a>.</p><p>Two new songs are just as impressive. The band, all multi-instrumentalists, layer the lusty, moody blues of Great Sky, before summoning the oncoming storm of Take Us Alive, with Tabish urging: \"Keep your eyes open.\" His careworn voice, backed by cellist Jenny Hsu, is affecting against his guitar during an encore of Black Tables, rabble-rousing for Leonard Cohen's The&nbsp;Partisan \u2013 encompassing all the elements of Other Lives' sound. All that touring might be muddling Tabish's brain, but it's paying dividends.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/music&k=Pop+and+rock&k=Music&k=Culture\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Other+Lives+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1728018&ch=Music&c2=148491&c4=Pop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Betty+Clarke&c7=12-Apr-05&c8=1728018&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2012/apr/05/other-lives-review|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|aed1ff56a8f9d99ee1eab145ea9e661614d633e5 -->",

Wedged among the almost&nbsp;exclusively female audience are&nbsp;lots of little girls \u2013 a whole new generation of Steps fans.</p><p>The enduring appeal of the fivesome lies in their offering a pop experience that combines the delights (or horrors) of a hen party with a night singing karaoke. There are dancers and silly costumes. Neither wrinkles nor Claire Richards's reality TV-documented fluctuating weight have dimmed their ability to sound like Abba on helium. The entire repertoire is delivered in a fiendishly high register, which must hypnotise grown adults into mimicking the group's trademark dance routines.</p><p>To avoid this being a purely nostalgic experience (or, whisper it, because they didn't have as many hits first time round as you might guess) new covers \u2013 including Lady Gaga's Judas and Maroon 5's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRsxpoAc5w\" title=\"\">Moves Like Jagger</a> \u2013 have been added to old ones such as Kylie's Better the Devil You Know.</p><p>However, the Steps experience isn't about the music: it's about daft fun, dizzying graphics, knowing glances and unintentional comedy. When the band run off stage, their breakthrough hit <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NO-h9PFum4\" title=\"\">5,6,7,8</a> just carries on without them. There's a particularly unfortunate moment when one of the&nbsp;camera operators illustrates the tearjerker When&nbsp;I Said Goodbye with a&nbsp;lingering shot of Lee Latchford-Evans's crotch.</p><p>Although the petite, pretty Lisa Scott Lee presumably has a Dorian Gray-style portrait in the attic, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2113835/Claire-Richards-Steps-bandmates-worried-wont-dance-routines-gaining-weight.html\" title=\"\">Richards's struggles</a> have clearly struck a chord with the audience, and her big-lunged rendition of Celine Dion's usually ghastly I Surrender brings the house down, with sparks falling from the ceiling.

        "body":"<p><a href=\"http://www.christymoore.com/\" title=\"\">Christy Moore</a> may be in his mid 60s, but he is still a fine, soulful singer and an entertainer who dares to challenge his audiences. A burly figure, dressed in black T-shirt and jeans, he perched on a stool alongside <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/artists/1a13c590-3ce7-462f-a567-05a90909d886\" title=\"\">Declan Sinnott</a>, his acoustic guitar-playing sparring partner since the late 1990s, and hurtled into a non-stop set that lasted over two hours with no interval. There were constant changes of mood and direction, as Moore switched between thoughtful history lessons, lyrical Irish songs and comedy, but it was the poignant or angry political songs that succeeded best.</p><p>He started bravely with a <a href=\"http://www.jacksonbrowne.com/\" title=\"\">Jackson Browne</a> protest song, How Long, then moved on to <a href=\"http://saccoandvanzetti.org/\" title=\"\">Sacco &amp; Vanzetti</a>, tackling the controversial execution of two Italian immigrants in America in the 20s. Then he changed direction with the unashamedly emotional Missing You, a story of Irish workers in London on which Sinnott played slide guitar, and a cheerful tribute to the Barrowland hall in Glasgow. Then it was back to the furious social comment with a quietly powerful treatment of On Morecambe Bay, Kevin Littlewood's fine song about the drowning of migrant Chinese cockle-pickers, followed by a furious version of Ordinary Man, dealing with unemployment, and Veronica, his tribute to the campaigning Irish journalist <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/96202/veronica.guerin\" title=\"\">Veronica Guerin</a>, murdered by drug gangs.</p><p>Towards the end, the changes were even more abrupt. A cheerful singalong My Little Honda 50 was followed incongruously by a powerfully sung traditional ballad of love and murder, Little Musgrave, and then his plea for Irish reconciliation, North and South. Later, the comic Don't Forget Your Shovel, now dressed up with jokes about Camilla, was followed by <a href=\"http://www.topicrecords.co.uk/?cat=28\" title=\"\">Ewan MacColl</a>'s love ballad Sweet Thames Flow Softly, and a finale that included the exquisite Cliffs of Doneen. He is still in a league of his own.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/music&k=Folk+music&k=Music&k=Culture\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Christy+Moore+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1727897&ch=Music&c2=148491&c4=Folk+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Robin+Denselow&c7=12-Apr-05&c8=1727897&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2012/apr/05/christy-moore-review|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|dd7e2753424038a03dd14d98ab4334fcd85b87b2 -->",

        "headline":"Met police officers on restricted duty over alleged racist remarks",
        "body":"<p>Three male police officers in east London have been placed on restricted duties for allegedly making racist comments, Scotland Yard has said, two days after the Metropolitan police commissioner <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/03/met-police-commissioner-report-racist-behaviour\" title=\"\">urged his staff</a> to report inappropriate behaviour by colleagues and declared  he would \"not stand for any racism or racists\".</p><p>In a development likely to deepen the row over allegations of racism within its ranks, Scotland Yard said on Thursday that after \"careful consideration\" it had decided to voluntarily refer the alleged incidents to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on Wednesday night.</p><p>The IPCC confirmed that an investigation was under way following the referral.</p><p>The three uniformed officers \u2013 two PCs and an acting police sergeant based in Newham \u2013 are alleged to have made the remarks this year between 6 January and 15 March. Scotland Yard said the comments had been brought to the attention of the Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS) on 19 March, two weeks before the emergence of separate allegations of racism in the wake of the riots. It added that none of the three men was involved in the latter allegations.</p><p>A spokesman said he could give no further information concerning the nature of the allegations. It is understood  the alleged racist comments were not made directly to members of the public.</p><p>In a statement, Commander Peter Spindler of the DPS, said: \"These are serious allegations that are being thoroughly investigated so that robust action can be taken if proven. The commissioner has already stated there is no place for racist behaviour in the MPS and we will work with the IPCC to identify any wrongdoing.\"</p><p>The fresh allegations have provoked shock in Newham, the Olympic borough, where the racist abuse reported last week also took place. In an attempt to soothe rising concerns, Superintendent Craig Haslam, acting borough commander of Newham, took the unusual step on Thursday of emailing local residents on a police information network, insisting  there was \"no place for racism in the Metropolitan Police Service and here at Newham\".</p><p>He wrote: \"Newham police are absolutely determined to police the communities we serve with dignity, humanity, fairness and respect. Any failure to adhere to these standards of professionalism will not be tolerated. What we have heard over the last few days is of course completely at odds with all the close work that goes on with communities across London and in Newham every day.\"</p><p>Estelle du Boulay of the Newham Monitoring Project said of the latest allegations: \"This is very serious, and it goes back to what we said [last week] \u2013 that this is not unusual in terms of with the reports we get and the kind of cases we deal day-to-day.</p><p>\"The only unusual thing about the first case was that this young man managed to capture it on his phone. For us it's finally some evidence that a culture of racism is embedded within the Metropolitan police.\"</p><p>She added that the prospect of an influx of police for the Olympics was \"particularly worrying\" for the borough.</p><p>The past week has brought the issue of alleged racism within Scotland Yard into the spotlight after the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/30/police-racism-black-man-abuse\" title=\"\">released an audio recording</a> in which a police officer could be heard using offensive racist slurs against a 21-year-old black man arrested after the riots last year.</p><p>The officer, PC Alex MacFarlane, has been suspended and senior lawyers at the Crown Prosecution Service are reviewing the case.</p><p>The sense of crisis deepened on Monday after it emerged that one of the officers present when the racist remarks were made, PC Joe Harrington, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/02/police-race-row-assault-claim\" title=\"\">had allegedly assaulted</a> another black teenager hours later. Harrington, who was the subject of an investigation, has been placed on restricted duties. The Met is considering what, if any, disciplinary action to take against him.</p><p>In reaction to the controversy, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, gave a personal address to his staff on Tuesday, saying  he had been shocked by the allegations and would not put up with racism within the force.</p><p>He added: \"We have a duty to challenge or report any behaviour by colleagues which is less than the high standard demanded by the service and Londoners themselves,\" he said. \"You cannot avoid that duty. Nor can I.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Metropolitan+police&k=Police&k=Race+issues&k=London&k=UK+news&k=Bernard+Hogan-Howe\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Met+police+officers+on+restricted+duty+over+alleged+racist+remarks+Article+1727674&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=Metropolitan+police%2CPolice+and+policing%2CRace+issues+%28News%29%2CLondon+%28News%29%2CUK+news%2CBernard+Hogan-Howe&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Lizzy+Davies&c7=12-Apr-05&c8=1727674&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/05/met-officers-restricted-alleged-racist|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|2e7547bc494f2855a58e302e6006fd3e92bb199b -->",

        "body":"<p>The BBC announced this afternoon that its expensive <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jan/12/babar-ahmad-victory-freedom-expression\">Babar Ahmad interview</a> (secured in the High Court in January, thanks to the services of Lord Pannick QC) will be broadcast on Newsnight tonight. Unsurprisingly, Ahmad <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/05/babar-ahmad-outsourcing-terror-case\">does not want to be extradited</a> to the US on terrorism charges - Strasbourg will announce on Tuesday whether his appeal, and that of Abu Hamza and two others, have been successful - and laments his seven-year detention without charge at Long Lartin. The broadcast is well-timed, given this current outrage over closed hearings and the terms of the UK-US extradition treaty, though the attorney general made it clear there was insufficient evidence to put him on trial in the UK. (Here's the 2004 US <a href=\"http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/ahmad/usahmad72804cmp.pdf\">charge sheet</a> (pdf) against Ahmad.)</p><p>On Tuesday the Guardian - apologies for trumpet-blowing - <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/apr/03/groundbreaking-judgment-extradition-open-justice\">won the right</a> to see the papers in another extradition case, despite the opposition of the US government.  \"The documents that the Guardian were trying to obtain were so basic you really do have to wonder why there was any opposition to their release,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2012/apr/03/guardian-court-victory-transparency\">says Article 19's David Banisar</a>, \"especially since no arguments were made that their release would cause any harm. Had the case been held in the US, they would have been routinely made available to anyone who wanted them. Perhaps it was US fear of having to release evidence in more controversial future cases.\"</p><p>The proposals for closed hearings, meanwhile, received a thorough <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/apr/04/mps-resist-cia-demands-disclosure\">going-over</a> by the joint committee on human rights. One of the witnesses who appeared before it was Joshua Rozenberg, who <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/apr/04/justice-security-green-paper-verdict.\">applauded</a> their verdict. Nick Clegg quickly <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/apr/04/nick-clegg-attacks-blunderbuss-tories\">withheld</a> (or withdrew) Lib Dem support for the justice and security green paper and Ken Clarke assured the Today programme that judges would have the final say on whether a hearing should be held in secret - though that, as Richard Norton-Taylor <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/libertycentral/2012/apr/04/secret-justice-ken-clarke\">points out</a>, was not what the green paper itself said. </p><p>\"One of the most serious problems with the green paper is that there is no mechanism or indication of when \u2013 if ever \u2013 closed judgments can be revealed.

        "headline":"Wanted: software to track a collection of slides",
        "body":"<p><em>I've been seeking advice about the best approach to cataloguing and managing a 35mm slide collection that I use for giving slideshows to raise funds for charity. One line of advice has been that I could do what I want using Excel, with the proviso that this is perhaps not the most elegant way of tackling it; others have recommended Access, of which I have absolutely no experience. In <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/askjack/2009/nov/05/microsoft-office-access-replacement\">Ask Jack on 5 November 2009</a>, you said that you were not a fan of Access. Which program you would recommend as an alternative for a single-user application?</em><br /><strong>Glyn Duggan</strong><br /><br />Microsoft Office Access, as it's now called, is undoubtedly a popular business tool, and a reasonably skilled programmer can use it to develop all kinds of applications. However, I find it far from user-friendly, and it represents massive overkill for your type of application. Sledgehammer, meet peanut.</p><p>If you already have Access as part of Microsoft Office System 2007 or 2010, then it could be solution if you can find a pre-written template that does (more or less) what you need. There are plenty of templates around, but a search for <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/CT010253079.aspx\">photo albums</a> at the Microsoft Office site finds <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/CT010253079.aspx?av=zac\">no results for Access</a>, nor do searches for photo catalog, slide catalog and similar terms. The most likely thing I could find is the Collections template at <a href=\"http://www.accesstogo.org.uk/Collections_Database.html\">AccessToGo</a>, but I wouldn't recommend it at £95.</p><p>You could certainly do the job in Microsoft Excel, but it requires quite a lot of expertise to set up validated fields and make the result look like anything except a spreadsheet. Also, people who use Excel as a database (including me) tend to scramble them eventually.</p><p>You can find plenty of small database programs for cataloguing things on freeware/shareware sites such as <a href=\"http://download.cnet.com/windows/\">Download.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tucows.com/downloads?hp=A2\">Tucows</a>. The problem with photo cataloguing software is that it usually assumes you want to manage digital photos, including the EXIF data that the camera stores with the image file. An increasing amount of this software also assumes you want to do some simple editing and perhaps batch-file work. The best free examples include Microsoft's Windows Live Photo Gallery (the latest version, which is excellent, requires Vista or Windows 7) and Google's Picasa. </p><p>For someone who wants more of a database, then the free, open source <a href=\"http://www.digikam.org/node/341\">digiKam</a> (for Microsoft Windows, Linux or Mac OS X) is worth a look, though it is still a \"work in progress\". For someone who is a serious amateur or professional photographer, <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop-lightroom.html\">Adobe Lightroom 4</a> looks a good choice at its new reduced price (£103.88), and there is a <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=photoshop_lightroom\">free download</a> (719MB) you can try.</p><p>Since you presumably don't have digital thumbnails of your 35mm slides, none of these programs is suitable for your purposes.</p><p>What I think you need is a simple, stable, fast, flat-file database that works like a card index. It would be even better if you could find a template for it that pre-populates the fields with useful entries such as date, number, subject and so on. If not, you will have to create your own fields on a single index card, but it shouldn't take very long.</p><p>As it happens, there is a simple, stable, fast flat-file <em>British</em> database that works like a card index: Cardbox. The pro version starts at £299 for a single user, but this year Cardbox boss Martin Kochanski made the Home Edition of Cardbox 3.0 <a href=\"http://www.cardbox.com/downloading/home.htm\">a free download</a>. Although I don't know exactly what your requirements are, I think Cardbox is flexible enough to do the job.</p><p>For the record, I was a happy Cardbox user in about 1983-84, and recommended it at the time.</p><p>As it happens, the Cardbox site does have a guide to <a href=\"http://www.cardbox.com/support/kb/photoarchive.htm\">Building a photographic archive</a>. However, it requires the Pro edition and assumes you will be storing images on Amazon S3. </p><p>In about 1993-94 (Windows 3 era), I started using an American flat-file database called <a href=\"http://www.asksam.com/\">AskSam</a>, because it had filters to import my CompuServe email and because a shop had a cheap offer (I paid £50). AskSam is still going: it's now up to version 7 at $149.95 (with a free 30-day trial).</p><p>AskSam will also do what you need, and you might find a <a href=\"http://www.asksam.com/templates/templates.asp\">free template</a> that you can adapt. However, the two things I like about AskSam \u2013 its vast range of import filters, and its Boolean search capabilities \u2013 are probably of no use to you, so I'd use Cardbox if possible.</p><p>Any Mac OS X users who are faced with a similar problem could try <a href=\"http://www.filemaker.co.uk/products/bento/\">Filemaker's Bento 4</a> (£34.99). This also has some <a href=\"http://solutions.filemaker.com/database-templates/index_home.jsp\">free templates</a> available, though I can't see anything designed for cataloguing a collection of photos or 35mm slides. (There is one for tracking your <a href=\"http://solutions.filemaker.com/database-templates/uk/detail.jsp?serial=2549928\">pencil collection</a>.)</p><p>The modern trend is to stick things in relational databases that use <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL\">SQL</a> (Structured Query Language). There are some good free SQL databases available, such as the open source SQLite, MySQL (now owned by Oracle) and Microsoft's SQL Express. This is probably the most secure format for longevity, but it's unnecessarily complicated for your purposes. Worse, different implementations of SQL often have nasty incompatibilities. However, both Cardbox and AskSam can export data in a variety of formats. If you need to move your data to another program at some point, this should not be difficult.</p><p>Although it's not a technical problem, entering the data for your slides, one at a time, could take ages. Start by entering the data for five or 10 sample slides and time yourself. Since you know how many slides you have, you can then work out how long the job will take. Bear this in mind when you set up your database fields. </p><p>Databases of collections usually fall in the \"nice to have\" category, rather than \"essential\". They're easier to start than to finish.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Technology\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Wanted%3A+software+to+track+a+collection+of+slides+%7C+Ask+Jack+Article+1727884&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Technology&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Jack+Schofield&c7=12-Apr-05&c8=1727884&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/askjack/2012/apr/05/ask-jack-slide-collection|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|2c56d4a64eb2acbe7e9d0c5594b00eb8f7dcf0f7 -->",

        "body":"<p>Swedish firm Propellerhead Software is one of the key companies in the history of electronic music-making, having been responsible for software like ReBirth \u2013 which emulated Roland's famous 303 synthesizer and 808 and 909 drum machines \u2013 and studio package Reason.</p><p>Now it's making apps. Starting with an <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/rebirth/id368199125?mt=8\">iOS version of ReBirth</a> in May 2010, and now with an entirely new app called <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/figure/id511269223\">Figure</a>.</p><p>The latter costs 69p on the App Store, and deploys Propellerhead's knowledge and technology in an app accessible enough to have non-skilled musicians grinning from ear-to-ear within a couple of minutes of starting it, as they blast out big beats and squelchy acid basslines.</p><p>\"I think we as an industry haven't been that great about inviting people in who don't have deep dreams about becoming big stars or understanding everything about music production,\" says chief executive Ernst Nathorst Böös.</p><p>\"It's time for that: I think everyone should be invited to be part of this. Figure is a small step towards that.\"</p><p>ReBirth was a logical first step for Propellerhead onto iOS back in 2010: Böös says it fitted neatly with the nostalgia in the apps world outside the music genre, such as people playing games like Tetris and Myst.</p><p>\"It was a good exercise for us, and people really appreciated it,\" he says. \"But ReBirth is very complex, and we decided that next time \u2013 the first time we'd make a new design for iOS or any portable device \u2013 we wanted to do something different.\"</p><p>Böös says Propellerhead thought hard about how the app would be used, or specifically the <em>context</em> in which it would be used. A couple are outlined in its App Store listing: \"Create an addictive beat before the next bus stop or lay down a beefy bass line while waiting in line at the bank.\"</p><p>\"People use their phones and iPads very differently from the way they use their computers,\" says Böös</p><p>\"There is also a different aspiration when we talk to users about why they're launching an app on these devices. We think a lot of the stuff we have seen so far on music applications doesn't really pick up on that. They pick up on the format: touch and the obvious things. But for us this is a completely different type of situation for music-making.\"</p><p>Figure was developed in six months, says Böös, who praises iOS as a development platform, not least because Propellerhead could use a lot of the code from its existing Mac applications.</p><p>He says that mobile now feels a lot like computers did in the early days of the company.</p><p>\"We helped to define how people make music on computers. We were the first ones to do the hardware metaphor thing, and to put programmable drum machines on a screen,\" he says.</p><p>\"We had to figure out a lot of things, because there was no [existing] method for doing all that stuff. And we re-used that knowledge for a new platform, where we're trying to look at it with a fresh perspective.\"</p><p>Böös says Propellerhead is \"committed\" to Figure as an app, although the company isn't saying yet what its plans are for new features in future upgrades.</p><p>One direction might be more social features, to help people share the music they create in Figure with friends. Böös says that Propellerhead is already getting plenty of feedback from first-day users of the app, but also has a strong idea of what the main requests will be from using it internally and showing it to friends in the run-up to its launch.</p><p>The 69p price clearly had a lot of thought behind it, in terms of getting Figure out to a mass audience. \"It's been part of what we've always done, trying to lower the barriers and allow people to have a chance to have a 303, a console to mix on, 200 tracks of audio to record on and really powerful synthesizers,\" he says.</p><p>\"There is philosophical marketing thought behind the price, as well as, well, what the hell!\"</p><p>Böös adds that Propellerhead isn't differentiating between professional musicians and non-musically skilled iPhone owners who might play with the app, though.</p><p>\"We think musicians, regardless what level they're on, will have phones, tablets and computers, and they will use them in different situations,\" he says.</p><p>\"Think about email: you write an email differently when you write it on your phone, compared to sitting down at your computer, taking a deep breath and writing a longer one. It's still emailing, but dependent on the device and the situation. That's how we see this.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Apps&k=Technology&k=Smartphones&k=Mobile+phones&k=Music&k=Electronic+music\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Propellerhead+on+Figure+app%3A+%27Everyone+should+be+invited+to+be+part+of+this%27+Article+1727907&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Apps%2CTechnology%2CSmartphones%2CMobile+phones+%28Technology%29%2CMusic%2CElectronic+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CiPhone&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Stuart+Dredge&c7=12-Apr-05&c8=1727907&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/appsblog/2012/apr/05/figure-app-propellerheads-iphone|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|df751675daa01d79796aefce3577b7e27faa79e1 -->",

        "body":"<p>Barney McKenna, the last founding member of the Irish folk band the Dubliners, has died aged 72.</p><p>It is understood McKenna collapsed at his Dublin home on Thursday morning and was pronounced dead at Beaumont Hospital in Dublin. His family released a statement on Thursday afternoon confirming his death.</p><p>McKenna had been in the band since 1962 and was among the latest lineup, which recently finished the 12-gig UK leg of their 50th anniversary tour, including dates in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds and Cardiff.</p><p>They also toured Switzerland in February after their two sold-out concerts at Dublin's Christchurch Cathedral at the end of January. Other late members Ronnie Drew, Ciarán Bourke and Luke Kelly, who have died since the band famously formed in the snug of O'Donoghue's pub on Merrion Row in 1962, were remembered during emotional scenes at the gigs.</p><p>Born in 1939 in Donnycarney in north Dublin, McKenna also played the mandolin and the melodeon. But he was renowned among fans for his storytelling as well as his musicianship.</p><p>Musician and broadcaster Kieran Hanrahan said top banjo players in both Ireland and the UK during the 1960s and 1970s all owed a debt to McKenna.</p><p>\"Every single one of them would have pointed to an influence by Barney McKenna,\" he said. \"He was the single most important figure in tenor banjo playing in Irish traditional music.\"</p><p>Hanrahan said McKenna started interpreting traditional music on the banjo like old traditional fiddle players, flute players or pipers.</p><p>\"He also had a technique of playing with his plectrum with his right hand which no one had seen before,\" he said.</p><p>\"The beauty of all that and the beauty of Barney McKenna as a gentleman \u2013 to me, the most influential man \u2013 it did not matter who you were, 65 years or five, if you showed an interest in the banjo, he'd sit down with you and show you what he was doing.\"</p><p>The Dubliners appeared on Top of the Pops in 1987 with Shane MacGowan and The Pogues for a version of the Irish Rover. They became synonymous with Irish music not only in the UK, but among the Irish diaspora in North America, Australia and across the world.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/music&k=Folk+music&k=Music&k=Culture&k=Ireland&k=Europe&k=World+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Dubliners+last+founder+and+banjo+player+Barney+McKenna+dies+Article+1727890&ch=Music&c2=148491&c4=Folk+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture%2CIreland+%28News%29%2CEurope+%28News%29%2CWorld+news%2CUK+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Henry+McDonald%2C+Ireland+correspondent+and+agencies&c7=12-Apr-05&c8=1727890&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2012/apr/05/dubliners-founder-barney-mckenna-dies-banjo|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|5318f8560f99fbbecad70f29c4412a1c20f2e35b -->",

As part of our increasing commitment to online video, the team behind Newton now has a <a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/newton\">dedicated space</a> on the Guardian's website to showcase their work. They will operate independently and make the films they feel are important or entertaining (although, no doubt, there will be plenty of Guardian collaborations too).</p><p>There will be interviews with scientists, fascinating lectures, heated debates and topical reports, and perhaps even science-y meetings in pubs that might be of interest to an even wider audience.</p><p>Through Newton, we hope the science website will be filled with new voices and fascinating nuggets of information that you'll want to share. Our aim with the partnership is to bring readers another way to enjoy science stories, complementing the extensive coverage already available through our blogs, podcasts and news reporting.</p><p>At the <a href=\"http://guardian.co.uk/newton\" title=\"\">new home for Newton</a> on the Guardian's website, you will find the archive of films that we have already featured \u2013 some of which will be featured on the Guardian science front page and through our social media streams in the coming weeks to remind you what's there.</p><p>Every week, the Newton team will add new films to the page as they are made.

        "headline":"Former head of structured credit: 'We saw numbers behave in ways barely conceived possible'",
        "body":"<p><em>As head of the department where \"exotic\" financial products turned toxic, he was at the centre of the financial storm in 2008 and beyond. We are meeting for lunch one day in January. He is a very engaging, slightly restless English man in his mid-30s. Though a great lover of cider, he orders a ginger beer with his pork pie.</em></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>\"Those were scary days. You think: we are in a new paradigm. Nothing works any more the way it used to. My department's potential losses were hundreds of millions of pounds and several billions across the whole of the bank. We began to realise: this could sink the bank. In fact, we were bankrupt three or four times; our bank owed more than it owned. We were lucky to have a parent company with very deep pockets. I was struggling to keep it afloat. If the market had crashed further we would have gone down.</p><p>\"All that started more than three years ago. Almost a year ago I left the bank, and I am still nursing myself; the night sweats have gone but I have this skin condition. It was stress. I pretty much engineered my own exit from the bank. Earlier they couldn't let me go, I was one of the few who had intimate knowledge of the products that blew up. In fact, in those last years they paid me more than ever. This was a bomb and I was basically the only one who could defuse it.</p><p></p><p>\"How credit derivatives work is not easy to explain and I'll come back to it later. When credit derivatives were still young, the Financial Times called people like us the 'F9 model monkeys', after the key you press to get the algorithm to tell you how things are going; what the value is of your portfolio. 'Monkey' alluded to the fact that some of us didn't understand what the algorithms did.</p><p>\"In the years before, we'd know in our heads to within a few thousand what profit or loss we'd made for the day, then press F9 and have it confirmed by our systems. When the crisis hit we would press F9 and get a number that was totally unexpected. We'd ask: how can we have lost so much money? What happened?</p><p></p><p>\"You can imagine that all of a sudden our department began to receive a lot more attention. In the old days we would calculate our P&amp;L [profits &amp; losses] for the day, I'd send off a report to my superior and you'd hear no more about it. Now my report would be pored over by 10 risk managers in London, then 20 more in my bank's parent country.</p><p></p><p>\"This was enormously stressful. You really don't want to be caught out by a risk manager in HQ in the parent country with a mistake. Because that risk manager won't go back to you, they'll go straight to the board. What was much more stressful still was that most in the bank didn't understand our products. Even the risk and compliance people who were supposed to be our internal checks and balances \u2026 We began to realise that we had to teach them how to monitor us. Then there were the people I reported to, who were getting calls from the people they reported to. I learned that the people high up know just enough for the role they're in.</p><p></p><p>\"'Just enough' is not enough in an emergency. I would be on the phone for hours explaining to people of increasing seniority what we were doing. And I realised, they don't understand, not on a fundamental level. They will not be able to spot a mistake, correct us when we fuck up, or take an informed decision. It was down to us, and I was losing precious time talking to the top people. And to their underlings. This was when I would explode; when people would be sent to me with a question they did not themselves understand. I would tell them, 'Look, you're adding no value. If you tell me you don't understand the question you're asking me, that's fine. I will sit down and explain. But how can my answer to your question be of any value when you don't even understand what you're trying to get me to tell you?' I would get very mad.</p><p></p><p>\"I learned about human nature in those days. The arse-covering \u2026 At one point we worked out a solution to the biggest of our problem positions. We'd have to take another loss but then the thing would be back under control. So we propose this and it gets shot down by the top. The bank did not want to acknowledge more losses at that point, and chose to let it fester and face considerably bigger losses later on. When we realised this, our team began to send emails, purely to cover ourselves: 'As discussed in meeting X, this is our proposal. I am strongly encouraging\u2026' We knew they wouldn't go for it but we were not sending these emails to them. We were sending them to potential future investigators and prosecutors.</p><p>\"It was during this time that I realised that all major banks and corporations are doing this. They are burying and pushing back bad stuff till the books for that fiscal year close, just to make the numbers look better. I don't trust their annual reports at all any more. They massage them until they look the way they want them to look.</p><p></p><p>\"I said earlier that structured credit is not easy to explain to the bloke in the street. It covers a range of products to do with derivatives of some sort. The two terms here are credit default swaps or CDS, and collateralised debt obligations, or CDO.</p><p>\"I am going to simplify. Suppose you are in some way dependent on a corporation or government. Maybe you are an investor who lent them money. Or a company that's in business with that corporation or government. In either case you worry about them defaulting and causing you to lose your money.</p><p>\"So what you do, you take out a CDS to insure yourself. If the corporation or government defaults, the provider of the CDS will pay out. Great. But it leaves the following risk: what if the CDS provider itself defaults? Who is insuring the insurer?</p><p>\"That would be the role of the CDO. They are exactly like a CDS but with two key differences. One, the corporation or government is replaced with a portfolio of assets. In our case the portfolio was a load of CDS. Two, the provider only pays us when certain conditions are met, which is usually after a certain proportion of the portfolio has already defaulted.</p><p>\"It's on one of these CDOs where we had our biggest potential losses when the provider of a CDO we had bought started to get into financial strife. We'd bought a huge amount from this one provider because it was so unlikely to get into trouble that the possibilities of loss were miniscule. Of course, there was always the possibility that this provider would default and in normal markets other banks would have stepped up to that challenge. But this wasn't normal any more and by the time we realised we might need some extra protection people weren't answering phones.</p><p>\"We had to be content with offsetting as much risk as we could by hedging. Hedging your bets when the bets are exotic credit derivatives is not easy. We had this algorithm that allowed us to calculate the trades we needed to execute to ensure we were 'dynamically hedged'. The program would know what positions to take on the financial markets, making sure that when one element in our portfolio lost value, another would increase. Our algorithm allowed the traders reporting to me to estimate what CDSs and currency needed to be bought and sold in order to maintain a balance.</p><p></p><p>\"The program with the algorithms for 'dynamic hedging' was not a black box. I mean, the PhD guy working on my team, he wrote his PhD on that algorithm. Perhaps you might compare it to a game of chess. At the end of the day the algorithm reveals a certain position. When the crisis happened we ended up with positions that were very different from what we were expecting. But we did know the moves that each piece could make. It was a matter of reconstructing them, of back-casting and figuring out what had happened. We'd always find it, if not after hours and hours of trying and building and testing hypotheses.</p><p>\"We'd go over all the variables, the possible chess moves if you will: currency issues, interest rates in all these currencies, prices of CDSs, prices of different CDOs, some of which are not traded very actively so their value needs to be estimated by the program. There's the potential for human error so we'd go: did you update this, did you update that? We'd create hypothetical 'example CDOs' that were similar to ours with which we could tinker to see if it threw up any clues. We'd be there till midnight but we'd get it, eventually.</p><p></p><p>\"The team spirit with my direct colleagues, that was great. There were only a handful of us, like a Swat team, all from different countries because that's the City of London for you. And the environment was intellectually challenging, to put it mildly. It helped that I wasn't the one who had traded the products that were blowing up in our face. They lost our bank a lot of money. They lost our clients a lot of money. But I could be fairly dispassionate because it hadn't been me who sold them the products.</p><p></p><p>\"Could this meltdown have been avoided? Should rating agencies have spotted it? Well, this is how it would work with the rating agencies when we were building a new CDO. They would tell us their parameters and criteria; if you meet this requirement, you get that rating and so on. And they gave out a free model so we could test our product and tweak our portfolio for the CDO until it fit, I mean get the rating that we wanted. We would do a lot of stress-testing ourselves too, of course we would. We'd pretend the market changed and run the models to see how our products would hold.</p><p>\"But what happened during the financial crisis was like a perfect storm. In our tests we would assume the market moved, say, 10% \u2013 while in reality it rarely moved more than 1%. Now the crisis happens and suddenly the market moves 30%. Our models were based on what we saw as normal. Now we saw numbers behave in ways barely conceived possible.</p><p>\"Say you are an insurer and in any given year about 3% of car drivers get into an accident. For decades this is the percentage. Then suddenly the rate jumps to 25%. It was crazy, crazy. They call it a 'black swan' event; something theoretically possible yet totally unforeseen that changes things forever. You believe for centuries all swans are white. One day, you see a black one. Your model collapses.</p><p>\"One thing we didn't model for was politics getting involved. Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac, the mortgage insurers in the US, were taken into conservatorship by the American government. Technically this was a form of default and hence it triggered some of the CDS in our CDOs. Nobody saw that coming when we put the CDO together a few years before. How could we?</p><p>\"It's easy for critics to say 'you should have planned for this'. I don't think they appreciate what a black swan event is; it is by definition something you don't plan for, as it is outside your perception of what is possible. I suppose it's like betting on a tortoise to win a horse race.</p><p></p><p>\"I like to think that I am an honest and reasonable guy. If I see a blind person crossing the road I will get off my bike and help that person. That's me. What drove me all this time was to do a good job. I am the sort of person who gets the punctuation right in every email.</p><p></p><p>\"In my final years I was making 400k including bonus. Our department was losing heavily but they couldn't get rid of me. It was weird how my pay really started to escalate during that time. They practically threw the money at me, I didn't ask for any of it! Each bonus time would come around and they'd say, we're paying you a bit more than we guaranteed to pay you. It's not much more, but it's a gesture of our thanks. And in the same breath they'd say, and for next year your guarantee will be X. Not once did I ask for more \u2026 How could I, they were paying me a lot of money. I knew I'd worked hard and I knew I'd helped the bank keep control of some gigantic risks, but that was just me being diligent. My grandad was a diligent milkman and my dad a diligent policeman, I was just being diligent in an industry that throws its money around.</p><p></p><p>\"Four hundred is not bad for somebody who entered the bank at 18 and worked his way up, all the way from back-office. I was the only one in my high school who did not go on to university. It was not for me. I fell into this business. And I don't think I was in it for the money, when I was in high school my parents tried to bribe me into working harder. I never did.</p><p>\"It was not great in those dark days of the crisis, being known to work in finance. Nobody in my social circle was in banking. My mother would feel compelled to defend me when somebody said something about bankers. Friends turned on me, on my wife. I would go to a party and I'd get fried by a socialist friend ripping into bankers. Sometimes I'd argue back, saying, look, I probably agree that bankers don't contribute as much to society as doctors, but let's extend the argument and let's start ranking every profession. Do you place doctors higher than teachers, or vice versa? Nurses? And customer service staff?</p><p>\"I am still trying to hide from people that I used to work in a bank; I don't want the parents of my children's friends to know. It can get so ugly so fast. The problem is, people don't really seem to understand exactly what they are so angry about. Do I suffer from post-traumatic stress? I'd rather think I'm experiencing post-traumatic growth. After all I have gone through, I feel there's nothing I can't do.\"</p><p></p><p>\u2022 Follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/#!/JLbankingblog\" title=\"\">@JLbankingblog</a> on Twitter</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Banking&k=Business&k=Credit+crunch&k=Market+turmoil&k=Economics&k=Global+economy\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Former+head+of+structured+credit%3A+%27We+saw+numbers+behave+in+ways+barely+conceived+possible%27+%7C+Joris+Luyendijk+Article+1720646&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=148491&c4=Banking+%28Business+sector%29%2CBusiness%2CCredit+crunch+%28Business%29%2CMarket+turmoil%2CEconomics+%28Business%29%2CGlobal+economy+%28Business%29%2CStock+markets%2CFinancial+crisis+%28Business%29%2CWorld+news%2CFinancial+sector+%28business%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Joris+Luyendijk&c7=12-Apr-05&c8=1720646&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/joris-luyendijk-banking-blog/2012/apr/05/former-head-structured-credit-voices-finance|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|12d2d0f07e262f75b61646fb7098bebc9adb531e -->",

        "body":"<p>Choosing a band name can be a tricky business, not least because the good ones are nearly always taken. So it was when friends Gwil, Joe and Thom from Leeds formed FILMS, only to have the biog for another band called the Films copied word for word in an early feature on them. They toyed with the idea of renaming themselves Daljit Dhaliwal, after the broadcaster, before settling on alt-J, or ∆, the shape that's formed when you press alt and J on a Mac. Sound pretentious? Then how about this? The band never reveal their faces in publicity photos, at least not fully, choosing instead to layer their images on top of each other, artfully. Influenced by bands such as Radiohead and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, alt-J's songs take the earnestness of the former and marry it to the playfully tetchy stylings of the latter, with instinctive signature changes and undulating melodies. The highlight of their forthcoming debut album, An Awesome Wave, is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/altjband\">Breezeblocks</a>, which is given a glitchy rerub by German producer B-Ju. Premiered here exclusively and available as a free download, the remix takes the song's jittery charm and accentuates it, elongating the intro into a tapestry of looped vocal samples and tightly strung guitars before the whole thing starts to resemble a Timbaland beat by the end.</p><p>\u2022 Breezeblocks is released on 21 May via Infectious Music.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/music&k=Music&k=Electronic+music&k=Pop+and+rock&k=Culture\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=New+music%3A+alt-J+%E2%80%93+Breezeblocks+%28B-Ju+Remix%29+Article+1727709&ch=Music&c2=148491&c4=Music%2CElectronic+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CPop+and+rock+%28Music+genre%29%2CCulture&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Michael+Cragg&c7=12-Apr-05&c8=1727709&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/musicblog/2012/apr/05/alt-j-breezeblocks|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|dd3b8ed8fa71392eb4c4c96f935a5b5ef719474d -->",

        "headline":"Masters 2012: Get ready for the 'Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods show'",
        "body":"<p>Who knows what the next four days at Augusta National will bring, but we all can be sure that the 2012 Masters is the most anticipated major championship for years. You can read it in the press, you can feel it in the whisper of the crowd and you can see in the faces of the players.</p><p>Even the eminently quotable Ian Poulter, who can usually be relied upon to stir the pot on the eve of these great state occasions, took the fifth amendment when asked if Tiger Woods would finish higher than fourth this week (a reference to last year's kerfuffle, when the English golfer airily dismissed the former world No1's chances).</p><p>\"Not going there,\" he said with a wry smile before heading off to the practice area. If Poulter won't join in the knockabout fun, then clearly something is afoot.</p><p>That something of course is the annual spring ritual known as the Masters. This tournament is a serious affair in any year but the first major championship of 2012 brings with it a degree of excitement that has not been seen since perhaps 1997, when a skinny kid called Tiger Woods arrived here for his first tilt at Augusta National as a professional.</p><p>The expectation was huge that year and Woods measured up to it and more, famously winning by a record 12 shots. The American's victory heralded a new age in the sport, one of those moments that will be remembered for more than just the scores on the leaderboard. The page had turned on an era.</p><p>This observation brings us to the palpable expectations that surround the 2012 Masters, clogging the air like Augusta pollen. In every year there is long list of potential winners and storylines of promise, but seldom have there been so many players in town with so much hope in their hearts.</p><p>Let's start with the overlooked, the likes of Luke Donald who by dint of some cruel alchemy will tee it up on Thursday as perhaps the most underrated world No1 ever. The Englishman speaks softly as ever but has developed a titanium disposition over the past couple of years. The criticism he isn't a \"winner\" no longer applies. He won the last time he played competitively, at the US PGA Tour's Transitions Championship in Tampa.</p><p>He racked up four victories last year, none of which were cheap, and finished joint fourth at Augusta behind the winner, Charl Schwartzel. If this tournament comes down to a simple question of who has the best short game, then the answer is Donald.</p><p>The problem \u2013 or at least the problem for the world No1 \u2013 is that Augusta National presents a broader examination than just chipping and putting. It was designed in the 1930s by Alistair MacKenzie and Bobby Jones to test every facet of a player's game, and its genius is that it still does.</p><p>Lee Westwood is perhaps the exact opposite of his countryman Donald \u2013 a great player from tee to green who has pronounced difficulties when it comes to putting \u2013 and he may also have a problem answering every question on the exam paper. But he has contended here before and if he somehow stumbles across a serviceable putting stroke, he will contend this week.</p><p>Is it impossible to imagine either Englishman wearing the Green Jacket on Sunday evening? Of course not. Just as it is also possible to believe the likes of Graeme McDowell, Geoff Ogilvy and Hunter Mahan could win.</p><p>The first two have already won major championships. Mahan has not, but he comes here as the form horse after two wins already this year on the US PGA Tour.</p><p>All things considered it is borderline rude to consign such fine players to the category of \"second tier\", but until events prove otherwise they will be seen as outstanding members of the chorus line, adjuncts to the main attraction known as the \"Tiger and Rory Show\".</p><p>Westwood has already made clear his contempt for Sports Illustrated's shorthand prediction of what the week will hold \u2013 \"Some people might have something to say about that,\" he said the other day \u2013 and Phil Mickelson has said the same, though not in so many words.</p><p>The American left-hander has won here three times and has put together a record at Augusta that is almost equal to that of Woods He is playing well and will take extra motivation from knowing that one more victory will see him equal his long-time rival.</p><p>Yet for all that, Mickelson must take a back seat. There is something bigger going on this week at Augusta National. The Tiger and Rory Show? Not really. It is bigger than that. It is a contest between old and new, between the past and the future.</p><p>Think of it in terms of boxing history, that moment when Sonny Liston stepped into the ring with the young Cassius Clay. Woods is cast as the former \u2013 the indomitable and unbeatable champion. McIlroy is the latter \u2013 fleet of foot and blessed with more raw talent than a man can spend.</p><p>Are they the best two players in the world? Publicly the likes of Donald and Mickelson will never agree. But in their heart of hearts they must know the truth \u2013 pound for pound, on their day, Woods and McIlroy are the best.</p><p>If, as many expect, the two principal players are at their best over the next four days then watch out. It is one thing when the two best players in the world collide and they are playing their very best golf, but when two eras collide we are transported into another world of sporting ecstasy.</p><p>How will this one turn out?</p><p>Only a fool would place their reputation on the line and make a prediction. So here goes. On Sunday evening Rory McIlroy will leave town with a new item of clothing in his suitcase \u2013 the Green Jacket.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=The+Masters+2012&k=The+Masters&k=PGA+Tour&k=US+sport&k=Golf&k=Sport\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Masters+2012%3A+Get+ready+for+the+%27Rory+McIlroy+and+Tiger+Woods+show%27%7C+Lawrence+Donegan+Article+1727556&ch=Sport&c2=148491&c4=Masters+2012+%28Golf%29%2CMasters+%28Golf%29%2CPGA+Tour%2CUS+sport%2CGolf%2CSport&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Lawrence+Donegan+at+Augusta&c7=12-Apr-04&c8=1727556&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/blog/2012/apr/04/masters-2012-rory-mcilroy-tiger-woods|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|ee7abf9ebbbcbc54e2130d7580d8142ced80bcfe -->",

        "body":"<p>The Chechen separatist leader Akhmed Zakayev has said he is not surprised by an alleged plot to kill him in London, and claimed that the Russian government is still actively trying to eliminate its \"enemies\" abroad, including in the UK.</p><p>In an interview with the Guardian, Zakayev said he still felt safe in Britain, despite MI5's assessment that he is on a hitlist drawn up by Chechnya's president, Ramzan Kadyrov.</p><p>Zakayev is under 24-hour protection from Scotland Yard. \"Do I have any choice?\" he asked. He said he was given round-the-clock security following the polonium murder of his close friend Alexander Litvinenko. \"It's been like this since 2006,\" he said.</p><p>The alleged plot against Zakayev emerged at an <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/357.html\" title=\"\">appeal hearing</a> last month. The home secretary is trying to deport a 45-year-old Chechen known as E1, after the security services said he posed a \"<a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/357.html\" title=\"\">serious threat to Zakayev's life</a>\" as well as to <a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2012/357.html\" title=\"\">national security</a>. Twelve days ago the appeal court allowed E1 to stay in Britain while he attempted to overturn Theresa May's decision to exclude him.</p><p>The Chechen is understood to be a close associate of Zakayev. During the first 1994-96 Chechen war, E1 was one of 12 bodyguards to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aslan_Maskhadov\" title=\"\">Alsan Maskhadov</a>, the military leader of the Chechen independence movement. E1 fought against the Russians, was wounded twice, and after the war became deputy commander of Maskhadov's presidential guard.</p><p>Maskahadov sent him to Britain in 1999. Soon afterwards, Vladimir Putin launched the second Chechen war. E1 claimed asylum in the UK and worked as Maskhadov's emissary, with his family joining him in 2002. During this period he was a frequent visitor to Zakayev's north London home.</p><p>In 2008 E1 left Britain and returned to Chechnya. Here he appears to have swapped sides and joined Kadyrov, who is accused of numerous human rights abuses and is a close ally of Putin.</p><p>MI5 and the US state department believe Kadyrov is behind a string of assassinations of Chechen exiles in Europe and the Gulf. Zakayev is believed to be on a blacklist of enemies whom Kadyrov \"wished to have assassinated\", they say.</p><p>According to court documents, MI5 claims E1 also played a significant role <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jan/15/chechen-murder-austria-russia\" title=\"\">in the murder of Umar Israilov</a>, a young Chechen emigre shot dead on the streets of Vienna in 2009.</p><p>One possibility is that Kadryov recruited E1 specifically to get close to Zakayev. A former member of his inner circle, E1 is said to have lived just down the road from Zakayev's and Litvinenko's homes, and had knowledge of Zakeyev's movements and security arrangements. The mere fact of his survival in Chechnya suggests he may have cut a deal with the authorities there; other former rebels who went back have disappeared.</p><p>Zakayev acknowledged he was the last commander from the first Chechen war still alive. A new, younger generation of explicitly Islamist radicals is battling the Kremlin and its local proxies across the North Caucasus. \"I'm ready for a long time that something might happen to me because this is official Russian policy,\" he said. A law passed in the Duma in 2006 permits state enemies to be killed on foreign soil. He added: \"For the past 12 years Putin has steered Russia in a gangster direction. He first used these methods in Chechnya, and then in Russia. He's now exporting them abroad. Putin considers England to be an unfriendly country. He is happy to damage its reputation while the Olympics take place.\"</p><p>Zakayev said he suspected Moscow's involvement in the attempted murder of German Gorbuntsov, a Russian banker shot by a hitman outside his flat in Canary Wharf two weeks ago. Gorbuntsov fled to Britain in 2010 after falling out with business partners and shadowy mafia figures linked to senior Russian officials. \"Gorbuntsov was an economic enemy. He wanted to exit from this criminal world,\" Zakayev said.</p><p>E1's case and the Gorbuntsov shooting raise difficult questions for the British government, which is keen to reset relations with Russia but faces the prospect of again dealing with a prickly President Putin. Putin took the refusal of British courts to extradite Zakayev \u2013 accused by Moscow of terrorism \u2013 as a personal insult. Putin has, however, indicated he will visit London for the Olympics.</p><p>On Wednesday Denis MacShane, the former Labour Europe minister, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/government-under-pressure-to-publish-names-of-russians-suspected-of-links-to-assassinations-7615359.html\" title=\"\">said in the Independent</a> that Britain should publish the names of Russians linked to political killings. \"The Russian security-business state thinks it can carry out authorised killings on foreign soil, particularly in Londongrad,\" he said.</p><p>E1's wife and six children are still in Britain. They were granted British citizenship in 2009. E1 was given indefinite leave to remain, later cancelled by the Home Office. His case was initially heard by the special immigration appeals commission. The case was passed to another court, with MI5 spelling out its concerns in an open statement. Last month three judges granted E1 the right to appeal against his deportation, with the next hearing unlikely to take place until next year.</p><p>The Kremlin has dismissed talk of a plot against Zakayev, a former actor who is prime minister of the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechen_Republic_of_Ichkeria\" title=\"\">Chechen Republic of Ichkeria</a>\", the unrecognised separatist state. Kadyrov's spokesman described the plot as \"nonsense\" and a \"clumsy put-up show\", according to the news agency Interfax. The spokesman added: \"Maybe someone in London needs to use Zakayev's name to whip up anti-Russian hysteria.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Chechnya&k=Russia&k=Europe&k=World+news&k=Foreign+policy&k=Politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Chechen+separatist+allegedly+targeted+by+president+says+he+feels+safe+in+UK+Article+1727502&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Chechnya%2CRussia+%28News%29%2CEurope+%28News%29%2CWorld+news%2CForeign+policy%2CPolitics%2CLondon+%28News%29%2CUK+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Luke+Harding&c7=12-Apr-04&c8=1727502&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/04/chechen-separatist-akhmed-zakayev|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|bdf35fba392e3d72a3ab9fd81e40d6a2b437f517 -->",

        "body":"<p>The police watchdog is investigating why a black man who used his mobile phone to record an officer racially insulting him was arrested for a crime he said he did not commit, less than six hours after complaining about his treatment.</p><p>Mauro Demetrio, 21, handed his phone into the custody desk at Forest Gate police station and told officers he had been abused and assaulted by officers when he was placed in the back of a van in August last year.</p><p>The recording captured one Metropolitan police officer saying he had strangled Demetrio, and another, Alex MacFarlane, saying: \"The problem with you is you will always be a nigger.\"</p><p>Later that evening PC Joe Harrington, another of the eight officers who were in the van, arrested Demetrio at the police station on suspicion of attempting to steal an ATM machine during the London riots.</p><p>Police raided Demetrio's house and he was later advised that no further action would be taken. He says he had no involvement in the attempted raid on the cash machine, and his lawyers are demanding to know why he was arrested by an officer he had complained about hours earlier.</p><p>The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which investigated Harrington, Macfarlane and one other officer in the van over the allegations of assault and racial abuse, has now said it will look into the arrest as part of its investigation.</p><p>\"The IPCC is aware of this issue and it is being looked at as part of the investigation into an allegation a 21-year-old man was assaulted,\" the watchdog said in a statement. \"That investigation is ongoing.\"</p><p>On Friday <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/mar/30/police-racism-black-man-abuse\" title=\"\">the Guardian released</a> the mobile phone recording, which captured one officer saying he strangled Demetrio because he was \"a cunt\" and \"kicking out\". Moments later, MacFarlane \u2013 who has since been suspended \u2013 is heard abusing Demetrio and adding: \"You'll always have black skin colour\".</p><p>On Tuesday the Met police commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe, responded by urging all 48,000 staff in the force to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/03/met-police-commissioner-report-racist-behaviour\" title=\"\">report inappropriate behaviour</a>. He said: \"I will not stand for any racism or racists in the Met.\"</p><p>The police chief reasserted his concerns on Wednesday, saying: \"We need to look at how we train our staff, particularly our supervisors, to not only stop this behaviour but also to ensure that they report any colleagues misconduct.\"</p><p>The IPCC referred Demetrio's case to the Crown Prosecution Service in January after concluding that MacFarlane, Harrington and the other officer may have committed criminal offences.</p><p>The CPS initially decided not to bring criminal charges against any of the officers. Last week prosecutors agreed to formally review that decision after Demetrio's lawyer, Michael Oswald, of Bhatt Murphy solicitors, threatened legal action.</p><p>Prosecutors are also urgently reviewing another case in which Harrington is accused of assaulting a black 15-year-old hours after the incident involving Demetrio, on 11 August last year.</p><p>Harrington has been placed on restricted duties pending the investigation into the second alleged assault, which was partly captured on CCTV at Forest Gate police station and witnessed by Demetrio.</p><p>Demetrio was arrested by Harrington hours after he handed his mobile phone into the custody desk and witnessed the alleged assault on the 15-year-old.</p><p>Oswald said he had not been told what evidence if any connected Demetrio to the attempted theft, which occured three days earlier in the midst of the riots. About 30 youths were reportedly seen using a stolen Mercedes to ram a wall next to a cashpoint at an Asda supermarket in Beckton. They dispersed when police arrived.</p><p>In a statement, the Met said Demetrio was rearrested after officers became aware of information indicating that his black Citroen C4, which he was driving when he was stopped by police in Beckton, \"may have been involved in the theft of an ATM\". Demetrio says his vehicle was not in the area of the Asda supermarket during the attempted raid.</p><p>Harrington's solicitor, Colin Reynolds, said: \"PC Harrington has never been formally accused of any wrongdoing in relation to the arrest of Mr Demetrio in connection with offences concerning an ATM cash machine. He has neither been served with a regulation 15 notice, nor interviewed under criminal or misconduct caution in relation to any such allegation.</p><p>\"Following Mr Demetrio being arrested on 11 August 2011, PC Harrington, at the request and under the direction of a supervising officer, arrested Mr Demetrio at Forest Gate police station in relation to another offence which he was then suspected of being involved in and in relation to which he was then detained.\"</p><p>He added: \"PC Harrington was not involved in that case and was not the officer in charge of that case and played no part in investigating or dealing with that matter. We are unaware of any 'wider investigation' being undertaken by the IPCC and our client has not been advised of any such wider investigation.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Metropolitan+police&k=Police&k=London&k=UK+news&k=Race+issues\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=IPCC+investigates+arrest+of+man+at+centre+of+Met+police+race+row+Article+1727450&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=Metropolitan+police%2CPolice+and+policing%2CLondon+%28News%29%2CUK+news%2CRace+issues+%28News%29&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Paul+Lewis&c7=12-Apr-04&c8=1727450&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/04/ipcc-investigates-arrest-police-race-row|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|590afb16dc65f11c50fbdbb201f8a22d6d350443 -->",

He worked for the National Union of Bank Employees and the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs, before moving to what was then called the Institution of Professional Civil Servants in 1974.</p><p>There he became assistant general secretary in 1980, and by 1989, when the general secretary retired, Brett had established himself as the inevitable successor, being elected to the top job unopposed. One of his first tasks was to oversee the change of name to IPMS, to take account of the new reality that the professionals and specialists it represented were no longer mostly civil servants.</p><p>Brett was considered one of the best and brightest of the new generation of union leaders. He was the driving force behind the creation of a federation between five unions with professional memberships, which seemed to offer economies of scale without loss of autonomy. But after three years he seemed to have lost interest in it, coming to believe that IPMS had no future as an independent trade union, and started to pin his hopes on a merger with the Management Science Finance union.</p><p>This turned out to be his undoing. The proposed merger was hugely unpopular, and the 1997 IPMS conference put it on hold while an enquiry established what the chances were of survival as an independent union. The enquiry reported that IPMS could survive. The merger was politically dead, and Brett's authority seriously undermined, criticised both for the merger proposals and for spending a lot of time out of the country on ILO business.</p><p>There was, he believed, serious work to be done in the ILO, where he was especially active as a campaigner for Burmese democracy (he lived to see Aung San Suu Kyi elected to her country's parliament). His old friend Denis MacShane MP says that he \"understood the importance of international trade unionism as a mechanism for social change\".</p><p>Due to stand for re-election, and in danger of losing, Brett announced his resignation in January 1998 and the following year was made a life peer. But his greatest service to IPMS members was still to come. New Labour had come to power vowing not to privatise air traffic control, but very quickly started to privatise it anyway. Knowing he could not stop the privatisation, he \"sold\" his vote in return for reassurances that any firm taking over the National Air Traffic Service could not raid its pension fund surplus. Brett's old colleagues and members understood, and were grateful.</p><p>He is survived by his third wife, Amanda; two children from his first marriage, Martin and Claire; and two from his second marriage, Judith and Hannah.</p><p></p><p>\u2022 William Henry Brett, Lord Brett, trade unionist and politician, born 6 March  1942; died 29 March 2012</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/politics&k=Trade+unions&k=Labour&k=Politics&k=UK+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/politics/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Lord+Brett+obituary+Article+1726841&ch=Politics&c2=148491&c4=Unions+%28UK%29%2CLabour%2CPolitics%2CUK+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Francis+Beckett&c7=12-Apr-04&c8=1726841&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: politics/2012/apr/04/lord-brett|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|37579858e2e98743b754f32a2f59c078c294e900 -->",

        "body":"<h2>THE POINTY END</h2><p></p><p>To Stamford Bridge readers, and make it snappy. Chelsea play Benfica tonight for a place in Big Cup semi-finals and it turns out that \u2013 rather than being a place with more political intrigue than a dead complicated bit in Game of Thrones where you have to keep turning to the appendix to check who is foresworn to who, and who is betrothed to who on the morrow - west London is actually a place where careers are reborn. Apart from Andre Villas-Boas's. And Winston Bogarde's. And Fern \u2026</p><p></p><p>Anyway, not six months ago Roberto Di Matteo was the man who managed to be sacked by The World's Nicest Little Club, West Brom. Now he's the man who saved Chelsea. \"Roberto has brought in some new ideas and instilled great confidence in us all,\" said Ramires, those ideas presumably being not hating your manager. \"It's difficult to explain the change in our fortunes but we have begun to realise we are a great team with great players and have built from our first victory under him.\"</p><p></p><p>David Luiz, Raul Meireles and Didier Drogba should be fit to play after knack scares \u2013 but Di Matteo isn't getting ahead of himself. \"This is half-time and we're leading 1-0,\" said Di Matteo, as the Fiver realised with horror that it had missed the first 45 minutes of tonight's action. \"But a 1-0 lead is basically nothing.\"</p><p></p><p>Benfica's captain, Luisao, could miss the game with knee-gah! and holding midfielder Javi Garcia may have to replace him in defence. But Benfica boss and Bible co-star Jorge Jesus is in fighting mood. \"Chelsea had quite a lot of luck in the first match, considering we dominated the match,\" huffed Jesus as he warmed up for a spot of resurrection action on Sunday. \"We have the quality to win this game, obviously, and I'm sure that - this time round - we can turn the tables on Chelsea and do the same as they did in Lisbon.\" If Benfica do get past Chelsea, they face a trip to Barcelona, where Jesus will have to face another type of Messiah.</p><p></p><p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football\" title=\"\"><em>Join Paul Doyle from 7.30pm for live MBM coverage of Chelsea 2-1 Benfica (3-1)</em></a><em>.</em></p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p></p><p>\"I understand better why Mourinho gets upset every time he plays [at Barcelona]. In my opinion it was not fair\" \u2013 if you're going to start conspiracy theories, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, it's probably best not to pick famously gracious loser Jose Mourinho as your star witness.</p><p></p><h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2><p></p><p>\"Rob Kent (yesterday's Fiver letters) is being a trifle unfair on the blessed Adel Taarabt, for whom I hold a pure and manly love, without being blind to his deficiencies in the tracking back, winning tackles and making a cursory effort to win just the occasional header departments. The fez in question was taken from the crowd and placed on Taarabt's head by Joey Barton. It didn't sit there long, suggesting Taarabt was well aware that if he kept it on he'd only be accused of perpetuating national stereotypes. The shisha pipe later in the evening was doubtless his attempt to reduce the stress that would have been caused by the fear of someone writing to the Fiver to complain about his stereotypical behaviour. It's a vicious circle, you know\" - Michael Hann (Token Big Paper QPR fan).</p><p></p><p>\"Let me be the first of 1,057 Simpsons fans to remind readers that, in reference to yesterday's Fiver, beer and skittles do not equal vomit, but comprise a delightful recipe for Skittlebrau: the beer with candy floating in it\" - Ryan MacDonald (and no other Simpsons fans).</p><p></p><p>\"Very fine jamming of two words together so as not to have to choose which one of them is, you know, correct ('no need for City fans to stumble about east Manchester like a hoarde of disillusioned Hudsons', yesterday's Fiver). The way to remember the distinction comes from Ben Watterson's classic comic strip Calvin and Hobbes, where Hobbes recites, 'how many boards would the Mongols hoard if the Mongol hordes were bored?'\" - James McCarty Yeager.</p><p></p><p>Send your letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">the.boss@guardian.co.uk</a>.

He helped Real to a record five straight European Cups between 1956 and 1960.</p><p></p><h2>STILL WANT MORE?</h2><p></p><p>Several eye-knacked and even more arm-knacked footballers feature in <a href=\"http://bit.ly/HR25qK\" title=\"\">this week's Knowledge on players winning trophies while missing body parts</a>.</p><p></p><p>American Tom Lutz stuck some Spanish, Italian, German and French words into Google Translate before <a href=\"http://bit.ly/HZhNvi\" title=\"\">trying to pass it off as his own Big Cup press review</a>.</p><p></p><p>Class nerd Jonathan Wilson puts Lutz to shame by casually throwing in phrases such as \"entropic imperative\", \"bourgeois epoch\" and \"gloriously protean\" as he answers this week's Question: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/HVm9TE\" title=\"\">what marks Pep Guardiola out as a great coach?</a></p><p></p><p>Psychic Daniel Taylor gets out his crystal ball to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/HRfB8z\" title=\"\">predict that one of Sir Alex Ferguson's most gratifying titles awaits</a>.</p><p></p><p>And Proper Journalist David Conn gets out his sleeping mat as he explains why after 127 years at Drill Field, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/HFeYVM\" title=\"\">Northwich Victoria now find themselves homeless</a>.</p><p></p><h2>SIGN UP TO THE FIVER</h2><p></p><p>Want your very own copy of our free tea-timely(ish) email sent direct to your inbox?

        "body":"<p>Internet radio has come along way in the past 10 years. Before broadband and the advent of music sharing sites like <a href=\"http://www.pandora.com/\" title=\"\">Pandora</a> and <a href=\"http://www.spotify.com/uk/start/?utm_source=spotify&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=start\" title=\"\">Spotify</a>, where people can now share their own playlists, online radio was your only choice if you wanted to listen to music on your desktop.</p><p>San Francisco's <a href=\"http://somafm.com/\" title=\"\">SomaFM internet radio station</a>, an eclectic network of 21 channels playing everything from underground electronica, chillout, ambient groove, indie rock, underground 80s, avant-garde jazz and lounge classics, has been on iTunes before iTunes was even called iTunes! Rusty Hodge is its founder, programme director and general manager, and a general one-man broadcasting institution.</p><p>\"I've been doing stuff on the internet since '88 or '89,\" he says, when I caught up with him at SomaFM's nerve centre in downtown San Francisco. He worked for Real Audio, which developed the first streaming technology in the mid 1990s and DJed on college radio before officially launching SomaFM in 2000, becoming one of the first internet radio stations.</p><p>Instead of simply churning out music, SomaFM's playlists are carefully curated, handcrafted affairs. The music is streamed and segued 24/7 with no commercial breaks or inane DJ chatter.</p><p>\"One of the things I always loved about college radio was that they don't have any commercials. I thought it would be really good to have something like that, but whereas with college radio the programming drastically shifts after an hour, I thought we'd have multiple channels with fairly consistent programming on each channel,\" says Hodge.</p><p>Hodge, now aged 49, was a young dotcommer during the first internet boom in the 90s, working as a programmer for startups in the San Francisco Bay area.</p><p>Along with the help of eight part-time DJs, SomaFM has pretty much maintained a continuous presence on air for 12 years. The station is still going strong and with over 5.8 million \"listener hours\" a month is one of the larger internet-only broadcasters.</p><p>\"[The DJs] all have normal jobs, they come in here, grab new music that's sent to the station on CDs from various labels, we trade music between each other and they playlist together from their laptops.</p><p>\"The DJs connect their laptops to our playoff systems that run off a datacentre downtown and they schedule all the music for the day,\" says Hodge.</p><p>SomaFM started, like all great startups in the Bay Area or Silicon Valley, as a hobby in the garage of his house.</p><p>The station's most popular station is <a href=\"http://somafm.com/play/groovesalad\" title=\"\">Groove Salad</a>, playing a mix of ambient and chilled out beats that became a hit with techies, designers and artists who tuned in while they worked on their Macs.</p><p>\"When we got going, people really started liking it, and I thought wow, there's not much of this music out there. I already had a small ISP, <a href=\"http://soma.net/\" title=\"\">soma.net</a>, so we did some branding and a bunch of stuff came together and we registered the domain name in January 2000.\"</p><p>Somehow SomaFM has survived. It operates completely commercial free and relies totally on listener support, by way of donations.</p><p>During tough months, Hodge ups the fundraising ante with emergency appeals on its website or on Twitter and Facebook and loyal listeners usually rally to the cause. A third of SomaFM's revenue comes from regular subscribers paying anything from $10 to $50 dollars a month.</p><p>\"Internet radio advertising is horrible,\" says Hodge. \"They are all ads for dating sites, like bad banner ads, only in audio. I'm ethically opposed to doing that. I get complaints from music licensing companies saying SomaFM is not effectively monetising the music we play. But we play the stuff no one else plays.\"</p><p>SomaFM also raises money by selling mugs, t-shirts and hoodies, and has recently entered a couple of syndication deals, which are helping pay the bills. Still, overheads are high, particularly paying for bandwidth and servers, royalties and office costs and some months the station struggles and goes into the red.</p><p>Hodge says his biggest crisis came when the Digital Millennium Copyright Act was passed in 1998. When it came into force in 2002, internet radio stations such as SomaFM were suddenly looking at paying a whopping $1,000 a day in royalties.</p><p>He took the station off air for six months and was a leading voice in corralling small webcasters to fight the bill, pushing for an amendment that meant if a station was earning less than $1.25m revenue a year it pays between 10-12% of its earnings.</p><p>At the time, he told the San Francisco Chronicle: \"the small guy now had the means to reach the world but couldn't afford to pay for it.\"</p><p>The new deal was based on a percentage of revenue as opposed to a multiple of revenue. The deal was higher than they had hoped but it was affordable and SomaFM managed to scrape together enough cash to pay backdated royalties and were soon back in business. The station has not been off air since.</p><p>\"I'm respectful of copyright, but I think copyright law needs to be completely rewritten. We pay music royalties \u2013 I think we pay too much \u2013 and I'm also opposed to paying royalties that are not distributed to the right people,\" he says.</p><p>These days, he is keeping a close eye on the Stop Online Piracy Act (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act\" title=\"\">Sopa</a>), which he describes as scary because it's too easily abused. \"In the final version they had toned it down. In the original anyone could have come after us, saying we don't have permission to play their music and seize our domain, and we would have no recourse.\"</p><p>Despite the proliferation of internet channels and competition from other formats, such as the growing music blog scene, Hodge reckons it is now easier to start up a station, and radio per se continues to boom.</p><p>\"When we started out, renting space and data centres was hard to pull off. Because I worked at a dotcom, I had access to resources that allowed me to use equipment or bandwidth. Nowadays it's not that hard at all \u2013 the problem is getting the attention from listeners because there are so many stations. When SomaFM started, pre-iTunes, there were 40 internet electronica streams, now there are over 400 on the iTunes list, and a lot of them are not very good or consistent.\"</p><p>Hodge acknowledges that it would be very hard for SomaFM to take off today without a large advertising budget to get the station heard.</p><p>Along with other media bosses, Hodge sees the future in mobile devices. SomaFM already has a desktop and iPhone app, which he is busy upgrading, making it more social media friendly and readying it for 4G networks.</p><p>\"In the future, the whole experience for digital radio has to be in the car: you get in, turn on the radio and it's playing, you don't want to have to fiddle with bunch of things,\" he says. \"An important development would be to have your 3G/4G account available on any device. I want my radio in my car to be hooked up without going through my phone \u2013 it should be added on so the car radio gets to use my 4G plan.\"</p><p>SomaFM is already a fixture on many desktops and mobile devices, its listeners may be relatively small in number compared to a Top 40 station, but they are loyal, discernible and at the cutting edge of digital technology.</p><p><em>Tony Myers is editor of </em><a href=\"http://www.smartmoviemaking.com/\" title=\"\"><em>smartmoviemaking.com</em></a><em> and tweets </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/@smartmoviemaker\" title=\"\"><em>@smartmoviemaker</em></a></p><p><strong>This content is brought to you by </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/guardian-professional\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Professional</strong></a><strong>.

        "headline":"Hacking book: Leveson has to get to grips with newsroom cultures",
        "body":"<p><em>Today's penultimate extract from <strong>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</strong>* is taken from a chapter by former ITN chief executive <strong>Stewart Purvis </strong>.</p><p>He begins by looking back to the public seminars hosted by Lord Justice Leveson prior to the inquiry proper...  </em></p><p>I have never seen so many newspaper editors gathered together in one place... It was very interesting how Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of the Daily Mail, and Kelvin MacKenzie, former editor of The Sun, chose to respond... </p><p>They both decided to attack the inquiry itself. Dacre criticised Lord Justice Leveson's team as a \"panel of experts who \u2013 while honourable distinguished people \u2013 don't have the faintest clue how mass-selling newspapers operate\". </p><p>He then moved on to their remit: \"Am I alone in detecting the rank smells of hypocrisy and revenge in the political class's current moral indignation over a British press that dared to expose their greed and corruption?\"</p><p>MacKenzie called it a \"ludicrous inquiry\"... and  then went for the jugular, attacking Leveson's own professional reputation as a lawyer...</p><p>A few days later there was an unprecedented apology from MacKenzie in his column in the Mail for being 'disobliging' to Leveson. Maybe he and... Dacre realised their tactics had been over the top.</p><p>It is worth asking ourselves: what is the main problem for which Lord Justice Leveson and his panel of six assessors are trying to find the solution? </p><p>Is it the failure of the police to investigate properly a series of crimes? Or a failure of the system of self-regulation which the press jealously guards to itself?</p><p>I suspect that the view of the average citizen is that it sounds like a bit of both. But the view of these two editors... is that it is primarily the former not the latter...</p><p>Maybe by challenging the inquiry's purpose and personnel they were trying to encourage Leveson to focus on the police part of his remit and less on the press part. </p><p>And if it was encouragement with a touch of menace, well Dacre and MacKenzie both do menace well...</p><p>What Leveson got from his encounter with Dacre was something more lasting than a headline... In one paragraph halfway through his speech Dacre made a dramatic change of gear. </p><p>\"OK,\" he said, \"enough of being defensive. The truth is we are where we are. The perception is that the Press Complaints Commission is broken. It needs to be reformed if it is to regain trust, so may I make several suggestions.\"</p><p>His plan was that the...PCC should continue but there should be one extra and new body. He called it an ombudsman... He suggested a retired judge or civil servant, possibly advised by two retired editors, should have the power to investigate what he called \"potential press industry scandals\".</p><p>He went on: \"The ombudsman could also have the power to summon journalists and editors to give evidence, to name offenders and, if necessary \u2013 in the cases of the most extreme malfeasance \u2013 to impose fines\"...</p><p>There was shock and surprise all round... editors, academics and policy-makers alike were asking themselves: \"Did I hear that right?\" The disciple of total self-regulation advocating what sounded like some kind of back-stop statutory regulation.</p><p>There a number of things to be said about this. One is how pleased Leveson must be that it was a senior editor who has started the ball rolling on ideas for reform. </p><p>Two is whether many or any of the other editors present knew of Dacre's plan in advance... none spoke. That suggests to me this was an individual initiative not an industry one.</p><p>Thirdly, it is clear that Dacre does not speak for the industry because much of the rest of the industry doesn't agree with him...</p><p>Which brings us to the fourth and perhaps most bizarre thing to be said about the Dacre plan. That the only media owner who appears to be close to his position is the rival he dislikes most... Richard Desmond... of the so-called and seemingly unsolvable \"Desmond problem.\" </p><p>He who doesn't like the self-regulatory PCC but is happy with the statutory regulator Ofcom... He pulled out of the PCC, refusing to pay the subscription... </p><p>Getting Mr Desmond back inside the tent to stop him doing whatever he wants to do outside the tent in the direction of the tent has been a primary focus for the PCC...</p><p>At present, the PCC is funded and some say controlled by something called PressBof \u2013 short for Press Board of Finance \u2013 with delegates from the organisations which represent the national and the regional press.</p><p>It is clear to me now that a key issue is the PCC's relationship with PressBof as much as the PCC itself. </p><p>The PCC does not and should not stand any chance of survival unless and until it becomes a body which is truly independent from its funders, the very people whose content it is set up to judge...</p><p>But Leveson does not seem obsessed with regulatory plumbing... Half of [his] questions are under the heading \"culture, practice and ethics\"...in newsrooms... </p><p>Here are two anecdotes from my first jobs in journalism and the newsroom cultures I encountered. Job number one: 1968, while still at university, working... shifts at a regional press agency selling stories to national newspapers and magazines. </p><p>I discovered that the underlying assumption at this agency was that it was a risk worth taking to invent quotes from people who didn't exist. </p><p>I was even told of the name of a road where you should claim these fictitious people lived because the road was so long that nobody would ever bother to go and check...</p><p>Within a year, job number two... I became one of the first three BBC news trainees doing shifts as a sub-editor in the BBC radio newsroom. </p><p>My father, who worked for British Airways, rang me with a big exclusive story. Eager to impress I passed on the story \u2013 though obviously not my source \u2013 to the BBC newsdesk. </p><p>An hour later I was called in and reprimanded. The British Airways Press Office had denied the story. I had wasted the newsdesk's time.</p><p>Twenty-four hours later British Airways announced to the world what they had denied to the BBC. It was the lead story on the World At One, based on the account sent out by the Press Association (PA) wire service. </p><p>So those were the newsroom cultural stereotypes of the sixties. Tabloid newsrooms made up stories. Broadcasters wanted stories served up on a plate by the PA.</p><p>Of course, neither stereotype was accurate then, and over the decades both became less and less accurate. Tabloid newspapers got more concerned about getting the facts right. Broadcasters got out and about and found more of their own stories.</p><p>Coming back to the present, what can be done to change newsroom cultures where they need to be changed for the better?... </p><p>The former chair of the PCC, Baroness Buscombe, suggests that adherence to the editors' code should be written into all journalists' and editors' contracts, that there should be \"industry-wide protocols on news-gathering\" and \"a credible independent whistle-blowing system in place\" so that what she calls \"any beleaguered journalist can have free access without fear to a second opinion as to his rights in law.\"</p><p>John Lloyd, of the Financial Times and the Reuters Institute, has suggested a Journalism Society along the lines of the Law Society for solicitors. </p><p>He would love to see a day when you would be confident enough to reply: \"I'm a journalist and journalists don't do that\"...</p><p>But just in case the path to voluntary reform doesn't run smoothly, just in case the momentum slows, just in case some new scandal is revealed, just in case somebody or something is needed to keep an eye on progress, I think Lord Justice Leveson and his panel should not go back to their day jobs just yet.</p><p><em>Tomorrow:</em> The final extract is taken from a chapter by <strong>Steven Barnett</strong> in which he outlines the principles that should be embraced by a new regulatory system for the press</p><p>*<em>The phone hacking scandal: journalism on trial</em>, edited by Richard Lance Keeble and John Mair, is published by Abramis</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/media&k=Media&k=Leveson+inquiry&k=Paul+Dacre&k=Kelvin+MacKenzie&k=Lord+Justice+Leveson&k=Daily+Mail\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/media/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/media/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Hacking+book%3A+Leveson+has+to+get+to+grips+with+newsroom+cultures+Article+1726977&ch=Media&c2=148491&c4=Media%2CLeveson+inquiry%2CPaul+Dacre+%28Media%29%2CKelvin+MacKenzie%2CLord+Justice+Leveson%2CDaily+Mail%2CThe+Sun+%28Media%29%2CRichard+Desmond+%28media%29%2CExpress+Newspapers%2CPCC+%28media%29%2CPeta+Buscombe%2CFinancial+Times%2CBritish+Airways+%28Business%29%2CBBC%2CITN+%28Media%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Roy+Greenslade&c7=12-Apr-04&c8=1726977&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: media/greenslade/2012/apr/04/leveson-inquiry-pauldacre|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|f217f0218e09736c8982281294821efa5dfe7a09 -->",

        "headline":"Mad Men: season five, episode three",
        "body":"<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for those who are watching season five of Mad Men on Sky Atlantic. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode three</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/mar/27/mad-men-season-five-episodes-one-two\" title=\"\">Paul MacInnes's episodes one and two blog</a></p><h2>\"When is everything going to get back to normal?\" \u2013 Roger Sterling</h2><p>The answer as to Betty's whereabouts turned out to be simple; she was sitting on the couch all along. A noticeable absentee from season five's opening instalment, Betty Francis returned this week and provided some heavyweight drama. In the time since we last saw her, a diet of potato chips and double ice-cream sundaes has resulted in the addition of a striking amount of weight (apparently necessitating the pregnant January Jones to sport a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144528/\" title=\"\">Klumps-esque</a> fatsuit). She was also forced through a cancer scare. Yet somehow, the former seemed more dramatic.</p><p>The lump in Betty's thyroid had, by the end of this hour, turned out to be benign. All thoughts of mortality could be postponed for another day. But the dreamy state Betty had been in throughout the episode remained. She seemed disconnected from events around her, almost pacified, and far removed from the caustic firebrand of old. The final scene saw Betty even act indulgently towards her daughter, both letting Sally off her pudding and allowing her to scuttle off and watch TV. In seasons previous such an moment would surely have led to a fist fight (although Sally would also have eaten the ice cream in the first place). Here, however, Betty simply stared into the middle distance, absent-mindedly polishing off the spare sundae. It's unclear quite what's happened to her. It almost as if the erstwhile Mrs Draper has made a pact with her depression; I'll ignore you if you let me eat.</p><p>Also open to question is the nature of the understanding between Betty and her former husband. Upon learning of her lump, Betty phones Don in a state of distress. She tells him the news and Don is gentle with her, using her pet name Bertie. He's consolatory too, telling her \"everything is going to be alright\" (the thing \"you always say\", as Betty puts it). He is also disturbed, and subsequently brings up the news with Megan and Roger as a means of silencing their own complaints, of putting things in perspective.</p><p>But this response from Don doesn't seem to be quite about Betty. As Megan observes, his discomfort at the news is not enough to stop him conducting Freudian market research on Rolling Stones groupies. Likewise, as he discusses the situation with Roger, it appears that Don's real concern is his children or, perhaps, even, himself. He is forced to contemplate resuming the responsibilities of parenthood. It's not a prospect that pleases him. Don still has a hold over Betty's affections, it seems, but the feeling may not be mutual.</p><h2>Pete and Roger</h2><p>A lot of comments last week picked out the power wrangle between Mssrs Campbell and Sterling as likely to be a central narrative this season. Events this week bore that out, although by the end you might wonder if Pete hasn't blown his hand already. Mohawk Airlines came back in the loop after Roger lubricated the top brass with sufficient alcohol. In return Pete magnanimously gave Roger the account, only to call a meeting to vaingloriously reiterate that point to every single member of staff (and claim responsibility for hiring Michael Ginsberg, of whom more later).</p><p>Pete is in an interesting place. To Roger he's a kid, but he doesn't look or act like Peggy or Stan Rizzo, or even Harry Crane. He's a new father and 'burb dweller and essentially he's stuck between the two generations squaring off against each other. Each might be uncomprehending of the other, but neither understands Pete. It could be that while Pete succeeds at office politics, he also manages to simultaneously piss off both those above and beneath him. Which makes him an ideal candidate to become the next boss of SCDP.</p><h2>Ginsberg</h2><p>It's good to see a new character and especially one of whom, at first look, I can think \"Hmm, he might be good for Peggy\". Michael Ginsberg is a young, Jewish copywriter hired to work on the Mohawk account. He's sparky and he loves his dad. He's also an arrogant so-and-so who seems convinced of the truth of whatever he has said last. He was also apparently hired against Peggy's will, with Roger asserting that he had to prove SCDP's diversity to the Mohawk boys (not that I think Mohawk would have cared). Right now Ginsberg could be a rival to Peggy, an heir to Don or just another one of those young male copywriters who's barely in the door before he's out again (remember Danny Siegel? or Kurt?). My bet, however, is on him being the one to harness hippy values to flog an Oldsmobile. Or something like that.</p><h2>This week's notes</h2><p>\u2022 \"Go speak to darkest before the Dawn\" \u2013 you can always rely on Roger for a bit of jocular racism and perhaps it's surprising not to find him in blackface around the office. Either way SCDP has, in Dawn, Don's new receptionist, its first black employee. I didn't find the Dawn/Don confusion particularly amusing, but I do like the way Don is pragmatic about her appointment in the way he often is about events that turn out to have real socio-cultural significance.</p><p>\u2022 Harry Crane may have lost weight, but it seems likely he'll put it back on again (what with his 20-slider diet). He's also a bit of a joke, mistaking some random Brits for the second biggest band in the world. Don was certainly not overjoyed at having to be in his company. The boy should watch out, I say.</p><p>\u2022 What is it with the nasty checked suits? Last week Crane, this week Ginsberg. <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Rupert+Pupkin&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=c2l&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&amp;prmd=imvnso&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=whV7T_qDPKif0QXh2f2cCQ&amp;ved=0CFQQsAQ&amp;biw=1342&amp;bih=879\" title=\"\">Rupert Pupkin called</a>, he wants his look back.</p><p>\u2022 Who is Betty's friend with the terminal diagnosis? Anyone?</p><h2>Culture Club</h2><p>After last season's trip to Shea stadium to see the Beatles, this year it's the Stones \u2013 caught in the middle of their 30-date US tour to promote the album Aftermath. The band played a short but sweet set that included Satisfaction, 19th Nervous Breakdown and, no doubt to the delight of their teenage admirers, Lady Jane. It transpires that, as well as proving a hit with the girls, the Stones visit to New York that year attracted the attention <a href=\"http://garyrocks.wordpress.com/2011/11/07/mr-keith-richard-the-directors-of-the-national-jazz-federation-request-the-pleasure-of-your-company/\" title=\"\">of more august company as well \u2026</a></p><p>There was lots of TV referencing, to shows old and new. Ozzie and Harriet, a long-running sentimental family drama, had come to an end, while Bewitched had just begun a month earlier. Don gets compared to characters in both.</p><h2>Time stamps</h2><p>Fire Island \u2013 the destination for Megan's weekend with her friends and, also, a byword for the nascent gay culture. Megan has already shown herself to be far more liberal in her views than many of her peers, with her choice of entertainment at Don's party for example, but it seems like it may not stop there. A 1965 article in Playboy <a href=\"http://ukjarry.blogspot.co.uk/2008/05/121-shel-silverstein-on-fire-island.html\" title=\"\">by Shel Silverstein</a> - \"Footloose Shel visits the gay side of Gotham's offshore bohemia\" \u2013 was the first portrait of a gay community in the area, but it was in the 1970s that its legend was secured after it played host to a number of mammoth disco events.</p><p>\"Because Romney's a clown and I don't want him standing next to him.\" So says Henry Francis, expert political adviser. But he's not talking about Mitt Romney, American presidential candidate in 2012, but his dad George, governor of Michigan in 1966! Talk about dramatic irony! In truth this was one of a number of bum notes in this week's episode (alongside Betty's fatsuit and Roger's fortuitous insistence on hiring Ginsberg). No wonder the US right <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/mad-men-mitt-romney-charlton-heston-306936\" title=\"\">got all Fox News about it</a>.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio&k=Mad+Men&k=Television&k=Drama&k=Historical+drama&k=US+television\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mad+Men%3A+season+five%2C+episode+three+Article+1726885&ch=Television+%26amp%3B+radio&c2=148491&c4=Mad+Men+%28TV%29%2CTelevision+%28Culture%29%2CDrama+%28TV+genre%29%2CHistorical+drama+%28TV+genre%29%2CUS+television+%28TV+and+radio%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Paul+MacInnes&c7=12-Apr-03&c8=1726885&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/apr/03/mad-men-season-five-episode-three|2012-04-20T09:44:04Z|701ac2cad1c4ccaf049053209d7c59df00763d80 -->",

        "body":"<p>The <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Ministry of Justice</a> has spent £14,000 on pot plants since the coalition took office, and the Department of Health spent nearly £12,400 in just 10 months to March last year. The Northern Ireland office spent nearly £5,000 on flowers and pot plants and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport spent more than £3,500 (though it's worth pointing out that under the last government, in the year before the election, this was more than £15,000). Jon Trickett, the Labour MP who has spent the past two  weeks <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120326/text/120326w0001.htm#12032628000339\" title=\"\">asking departments</a>  how much has been frittered on foliage, is concerned about the use of public money, but surely the far more important question is: aren't pot plants really dated?</p><p>They are, says Kate Mason, associate at <a href=\"http://www.scottbrownrigg.com\" title=\"\">Scott Brownrigg</a>, the architectural design company that has created offices for clients such as Google, \"but what's happening now is planting is becoming part of the design rather than an afterthought.

We're also working for a couple of large clients where we're putting in <a href=\"http://apps.rhs.org.uk/advicesearch/profile.aspx?PID=547\" title=\"\">living walls</a>.\" Mason puts this enthusiasm for greenery down to the wider trend in workspace design to reflect more of a domestic style, because of \"the blurring of the boundaries between home and work\".</p><p>Jenny MacDonnell, director of research at the British Council for Offices, which promotes workplace design to improve productivity, points towards research that suggests \"having plants in offices is a good thing. It makes people more productive, happier, reduces stress, helps reduce dust particles in the air.\"</p><p>Mason agrees: \"We've read a lot of research on how planting affects people. The companies we work for have a maintenance budget and they understand it's not just about putting the plants in.\" But is this an issue when public money is at stake? \"Absolutely.

Maybe I'll never get to it now. But you know when you go into an Apple Store, and it's filled with sometimes scary Apple fanatics who seem to have arrived at a holy place? That's Google+ for Google.</p><p> If Google+ isn't anything else, it's a place that Google fans can call home. It's a place that Google's never really had before, a spot for its millions (and let's face it, there are millions) of fanboys and fangirls to rejoice in all things Google.</p><p> I've experienced this firsthand in my time at Google. I've learned that if I share anything negative about Google, I can expect to get comments, sometimes many, asking why I hate Google or am biased against Google.</p></blockquote><p> Sullivan generally writes positively about Google, and you can see how wrestling with his dislike of its slipperiness over Google+. The \"170m\" figure this week seems to have been the last straw, and won't have been improved by the complete lack of useful numbers in Thurday's quarterly results.</p><h2><a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-57412861-38/doj-is-likely-to-lose-e-book-antitrust-suit-targeting-apple/\">DOJ is likely to lose e-book antitrust suit targeting Apple &gt;&gt; CNET News</a></h2><blockquote><p>The Department of Justice \"has a far better case against the publishers than Apple,\" says Dominick Armentano, professor emeritus of economics at the University of Hartford and author of Antitrust and Monopoly who's now affiliated with the Independent Institute in Oakland, Calif. \"If the CEOs of the various publishers got together in hotel rooms to discuss prices, they are sunk\" and might as well settle, he says.</p></blockquote><p> Pretty much only leaves MacMillan to have to fight, then.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.publishwhatyoufund.org/news/2012/04/world-bank-demands-open-data-google-mapping-project/\">The World Bank demands open data in Google mapping project &gt;&gt; Publish What You Fund</a></h2><blockquote><p>The World Bank has confirmed that it will not support the use of Google Map Maker for citizen-mapping efforts unless it gives users free access to the map data they create.</p><p> The World Bank and Google have launched a project using crowd-sourcing to populate maps with the locations of public services in the developing world - a resource which could be used by many different groups in humanitarian and longer-term development work.</p></blockquote><p> Good move by the World Bank.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.asymco.com/2012/04/12/how-samsung-beat-nokia/\">How Samsung beat Nokia &gt;&gt; asymco</a></h2><p>Horace Dediu cuts to the chase: </p><blockquote><p>Looking at product mix, Samsung growth is shown to be almost entirely due to smartphones while Nokia's stagnant growth seems to be a failure to have any smartphone traction.</p><p> It's even more clear when showing the above mixes of devices as percents of total.</p></blockquote><p> Note that it's not as simple as \"Android\": HTC, Motorola, LG and Sony Ericsson have all adopted Android too, but all dwindled (some even worse than Nokia). Samsung has stayed ahead of the curve. Its success is completely deserved.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=5cL60TYY8oQ\">Inside Foxconn: Exclusive look at how an iPad is made &gt;&gt; YouTube</a></h2><p>Rob Schmitz (who was one of those suspicious about Mike Daisey's claims about Foxconn working conditions) gets inside a factory and gets filming.</p><h2><a href=\"http://waxy.org/2012/04/instagrams_buyout_how_does_it_measure_up/\">Instagram's Buyout: How Does It Measure Up? &gt;&gt; Waxy.org</a></h2><p>Andy Baio: </p><blockquote><p>The spreadsheet below captures the acquisition date, dollar amounts, and ballpark counts of the users and employees at the time of acquisition. Be warned: any of these numbers are very rough, cobbled together from Internet Archive searches, old news articles, Quora answers, and tech blogs. If you have more accurate information, please leave a comment and I'll fix it.</p></blockquote><p> Upshot: Instagram is a long way from being the most expensive purchase on a per-user basis from the past 13 years. To repeat: Instagram isn't the purchase that marks the top of the bubble. It's part of the bubble.</p><h2><a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5242\">About Java for OS X Lion 2012-003 &gt;&gt; Apple</a></h2><blockquote><p>This Java security update removes the most common variants of the Flashback malware.</p><p> This update also configures the Java web plug-in to disable the automatic execution of Java applets. Users may re-enable automatic execution of Java applets using the Java Preferences application. If the Java web plug-in detects that no applets have been run for an extended period of time it will again disable Java applets.</p></blockquote><p> Next step: just zap Java altogether. Works on 10.6 and 10.7. Users of 10.5... should disable Java?</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/04/apple-is-allowed-at-long-last-to.html\">Apple is allowed (at long last) to intervene in Lodsys lawsuit against app developers &gt;&gt; FOSS Patents</a></h2><p>Florian Müller: </p><blockquote><p>I wish the app developer community luck as far as Lodsys is concerned. I saw that some of the smaller defendants, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/gedeon/status/190541152125059073\">including Iconfactory</a>, settled the dispute on undisclosed terms, presumably because they couldn't afford the cost and deal with risk of protracted litigation. I wish the remaining defendants as well as all those facing the threat of being sued that Apple's intervention will help to get his troll defeated. I also hope that <a href=\"http://www.fosspatents.com/2011/08/googles-reexamination-requests-against.html\">Google's reexamination requests</a> will be successful. I still believe that those large players should do a whole lot more for app developers than what they are doing at this stage (for example, I believe they should give them blanket coverage against litigation costs)</p></blockquote><p> Let the games really begin.</p><p>You can follow <a href=\"http://pinboard.in/u:guardiantech\">Guardian Technology's linkbucket on Pinboard</a>.

The tool is available through the company's built-in Software Update system.</p><p>Separately, the security company Symantec <a href=\"http://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/osxflashbackk-suffering-slashback-infections-down-270000\">published research on Thursday</a> night as the tool was released which suggests that the number of infected Macs has dropped precipitously since the existence of the infection was publicised.</p><p>It says that the number of infections fell from 600,000 on 6 April to 380,000 on 10 April, to around 270,000 on 11 April - suggesting a dramatic cleanup rate among Mac owners. The greatest source of infection remains the US, with almost half of all infections, Canada and the UK, it adds. Symantec has also <a href=\"http://norton.com/flashback\">offered its own removal tool</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5242\">software update</a>, Apple says, \"removes the most common variants of the Flashback malware... This update also configures the Java web plug-in to disable the automatic execution of Java applets. Users may re-enable automatic execution of Java applets using the Java Preferences application. If the Java web plug-in detects that no applets have been run for an extended period of time it will again disable Java applets.\"</p><p>Users of the earlier 10.5 (\"Leopard\") verson of Mac OSX and its predecessors no longer receive security updates: they are advised to disable Java.</p><p>Symantec's analysis suggests that the suspected gang behind Flashback have been readying the latest version - which connects infected machines to command and control (C&amp;C) servers around the net on a rotating basis, using random-looking domain names generated afresh each day - since 26 March. </p><h2>iTunes account security</h2><p>Meanwhile, users of iTunes logging into their online accounts to buy items from the store are being confronted with requests to add backup email addresses, and security questions to protect both their devices and accounts.</p><p>In the recent past a number of people whose accounts have been compromised - either through the use of weak easily-guessed passwords, or because they have handed them over to phishing attacks - have seen their accounts used to buy expensive apps. </p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Apple&k=Malware&k=Viruses&k=Technology\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Apple+offers+Flashback+removal+tool+and+strengthens+iTunes+accounts+Article+1730766&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Apple+%28Technology%29%2CMalware%2CViruses%2CTechnology&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Charles+Arthur&c7=12-Apr-13&c8=1730766&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/blog/2012/apr/13/apple-flashback-java-malware-fix|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|18e1a360314ff2b5978005964f970f403aed5a4c -->",

          "headline": "Hillary Clinton and G8 ministers: peace monitors must be sent to Syria",
          "body": "<p>Foreign ministers from the world's leading industrial countries ended a two-day meeting in Washington expressing a joint determination to see international peace monitors deployed in Syria as fast as possible to observe the shaky ceasefire.</p><p>Although the G8 foreign ministers' summit discussed issues from the weekend nuclear talks with Iran to the imminent launch of a North Korean long-range missile, ministers devoted most of it to the clashes in Syria that have left an estimated 9,000 dead.</p><p>The US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, noted that the ceasefire negotiated by the former United Nations secretary-general, Kofi Annan, appeared to be holding, adding pointedly: \"At least for the moment\".</p><p>Ministers expressed concern that the tentative ceasefire might collapse before any significant moves, chiefly the deployment of monitors, are taken. </p><p>\"If it holds, a ceasefire is an important step, but it represents just one element of the special envoy's plan,\" Clinton told reporters at a state department press conference at the end of the summit. If monitors are in place, the next step would be the withdrawal of Syrian government forces from cities where rebels have strongholds and eventually a political settlement.</p><p>The foreign ministers from G8 – made up of the US, Russia, Japan, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and and Italy – met in Washington to lay the ground for a meeting of G8 leaders at Camp David next month.</p><p>Before the foreign ministers gathered, one of the main worries of diplomats from the US and Europe was how to keep Russia on board. Russia, a long-time ally of Syria, has repeatedly blocked moves by the UN security council against Syrian president Bashar Assad. But Russia has signed up to Annan's peace plan, and the other seven G8 countries held it to those pledges.</p><p>Clinton met on the sidelines with the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, specifically on Syria.</p><p>At the press conference, Clinton warned Assad against failure to implement the plan in full. \"The Annan plan is not a menu of options. It is a set of obligations,\" she said. \"The burden of fully and visibly meeting all of these obligations continues to rest with the regime. They cannot pick and choose.</p><p>For it to be meaningful, this apparent halt in violence must lead to a credible political process and a peaceful, inclusive democratic transition.\"</p><p>The Obama administration's line on Syria goes further than either the G8 nor the UN by calling on Assad to stand down. \"We remain firmly resolved that the regime's war against its own people must end for good and political transition must begin,\" Clinton said. \"Assad will have to go and the Syrian people must be given the chance to chart their own future.\"</p><p>Another pressing issue, unable to wait until the full G8 meets next month,  is North Korea. Diplomats warned that it would be \"inadvisable\" for North Korea to launch, as planned, its long-range missile as this would renew tensions on the Korean peninsula.</p><p>\"We urge the North Korean leadership to honour its agreements and refrain from pursuing a cycle of provocation,\" Clinton said.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Syria&k=Hillary+Clinton&k=G8&k=World+news&k=United+Nations&k=US+foreign+policy\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Hillary+Clinton+and+G8+ministers%3A+peace+monitors+must+be+sent+to+Syria+Article+1730750&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Syria+%28News%29%2CHillary+Clinton+%28News%29%2CG8+%28News%29%2CWorld+news%2CUnited+Nations+%28News%29%2CUS+foreign+policy%2CUS+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730750&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/12/hillary-clinton-g8-peace-monitors-syria|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|4dd8e713ef20584f45d1d5f5560d2d0ceec5f2a3 -->",

Tom McCarthy here in New York and here's where things stand:</p><p><strong>• A televised remark by a Democratic strategist that Ann Romney, the wife of Republican frontrunner Mitt Romney and mother of his five children, has \"never worked a day in her life\" has created a cyclone of indignation.</strong> Ann Romney started a Twitter account and said raising five kids was work, thank you very much. The Obama campaign is on the defensive.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I made a choice to stay home and raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work.</p><p>— Ann Romney (@AnnDRomney) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnnDRomney/status/190262588163100672\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T02:18:30+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><p>• <strong>Ann Romney will appear on television soon to talk about her husband's plan for women and the economy, and to discuss the remarks of the Democratic strategist, Hilary Rosen</strong>. The kerfuffle follows a Washington Post/ABC News poll earlier this week showing Obama with a 19-point lead over Romney among women.</p><p>• <strong>The Obama campaign has produced a video marking the sixth anniversary of Mitt Romney's Massachusetts health care plan, signed into law on April 12, 2006.</strong> This is an attempt to preempt attacks on Obama's health care plan. We'll post the video momentarily.</p><p>• <strong>President Obama will honor NASCAR champ Tony Stewart and other drivers in a White House ceremony. </strong>Will Danica Patrick be there? And will there be photos?</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.28am:</span> My colleague Ryan Devereaux has been looking into the Rosen brouhaha in more depth.</p><p>Barack Obama's senior advisers went into damage control mode immediately after Hilary Rosen's CNN appearance last night, with campaign manager <strong>Jim Messina</strong> and top strategist <strong>David Axelrod</strong> both taking to Twitter.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I could not disagree with Hilary Rosen any more strongly.

She should apologize.</p><p>— Jim Messina (@Messina2012) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Messina2012/status/190268575141986305\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T02:42:17+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><p><br /><em></em></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Also Disappointed in Hilary Rosen's comments about Ann Romney.They were inappropriate and offensive.</p><p>— David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/190270056977022979\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T02:48:11+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><p>As the battle warms up between Obama and Romney over whose policies are better for women, the<strong> Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act</strong> has taken center stage. </p><p>Signed by President Obama, the law makes it easier for women to sue in equal pay cases. When asked about Romney's position on the act in a conference call on Wednesday, his top policy aides seemed unsure how to respond. The law is opposed by elements of the conservative base Romney seeks to please. The Romney campaign eventually released a statement saying he supports the radical notion of pay equity. The Democrats wasted no time in seizing on the opportunity to release citing Ledbetter's \"shocked and disappointed\" reaction to the controversy.</p><p>Romney's strategy for taking the president to task on women's issues includes arguing that women have suffered disproportionately under current White House policies, particularly in terms of job losses. </p><p>On Tuesday and Wednesday the former governor repeatedly cited the figure 92.3% figure, which he says it represents women's share of all the jobs lost since the president's inauguration in January 2009. But it turns out that's not quite accurate. Though women have lost a considerable number of jobs in the last three years, men lost way more during the recession (which officially began in December 2007). Men are also prone to work in sectors that are vulnerable swings in the business cycle.</p><p>Romney's advisers on women's issues include <strong>Bay Buchanan,</strong> sister of paleoconservative Pat Buchanan. Like her brother, Buchanan is known for making incendiary assertions. Among her more controversial statements are the suggestion that the nation's \"social decay\" is the result of the feminist movement, that feminism is rooted in fundamental failures (women don't value marriage and can only be happy outside the home, the sexual revolution made free-loving \"alley cats\" out of women and the defense of abortion, for example) and breast cancer may be the result of past abortions.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">10.57am:</span> <strong>Ann Romney</strong> has just appeared on Fox News to talk about Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen's comments, and she turns in an upbeat, on-point appearance. She's asked for her gut reaction to Rosen's comments. It turns out she's no more given to moments of nasty passion than her husband.</p><p>\"She should have come to my house when those five boys were causing so much trouble,\" Romney laughs. \"It wasn't so easy.\"</p><p>Then she pivots into her larger point, that one way is not better than another. \"We need to respect the choices that women make. We have to respect women in all those choices they make. … And we have to give a shout-out to all the dads who are at home raising kids.\"</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.05am:</span> More from <strong>Ann Romney's Fox News appearance.</strong> Her job here is to show her husband as a man who respects and loves his wife and holds women in general in high regard. </p><p>She accomplishes this by saying so, and also by coming across as a frank, intelligent, relatable (!) woman who we can guess would pick well in choosing a mate.</p><p>\"I will tell you that Mitt said to me more times than you can imagine: 'Ann your job is more important than mine,'\" she says. \"By the way, Mitt respects women that make those different choices. He listens to a lot of different women.\"</p><p>Then Romney shifts to her campaign boilerplate, the part where she is a mouthpiece for women across the country:</p><p>\"I want to tell you what women are telling me. Guess what women are talking about? Guess what? They're talking about jobs, and they're talking about the legacy of debt that we're leaving our children. That's what we're hearing. And that's what they're talking about here.\"</p><p>More effective is Romney's answer to Rosen's assertion that staying at home was her choice and she never had to worry about money.</p><p>\"I know what it's like to struggle,\" the breast cancer survivor says. \"Maybe I haven't struggled as much financially as some people have. But I can tell you that I have had struggle in my life. Mitt and I have compassion for people who are struggling. And that's why we're running.\" She comes across as sincere. She's helping her husband here.</p><p>Ann Romney shares this, however, with her husband: Even when she's being sincere, the language she uses is sometimes so artless – so tinny, so evocative of a computer programmed to carry on conversation – that it rings false:</p><p>\"You should see how many women he listens to. That's what I love about Mitt. There are so many around him who he respects and admires.... Mitt Romney is a person that admires women and listens to them. And I am grateful that he listens to me and what I am telling him about what women are facing right now.\"</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.17am:</span> Is the <strong>Hillary Rosen scandal</strong> a tempest in a teapot? Is this all just Republicans making hay of an innocuous lapse of speech by a political commentator? Or do Rosen's comments expose a real insensitivity among Democrats to the \"traditional\" family – or a point of conflict between two political philosophies? </p><p>For the record here's what Rosen said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>With respect to economic issues, I think actually that Mitt Romney is right that ultimately women care more about the economic well-being of their family and the like.  But he doesn't connect on that issue, either.  What you have is Mitt Romney running around the country saying well, you know, my wife tells me that what women really care about are economic issues, and when I listen to my wife, that's what I'm hearing.  Guess what?  His wife has actually never worked a day in her life.  She's never really dealt with the kinds of economic issues that a majority of the women in this country are facing in terms of how do we feed our kids, how do we send them to school, and why we worry about their future.</p></blockquote><p>What do you think? Let us know in the comments and later we'll discuss the most level-headed and incisive analyses.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.26am:</span> We're about five minutes away from a <strong>Romney campaign conference call</strong> on how the president's economy policies are \"failing women.\" Participating will be Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Rep. Cynthia Lummis. </p><p>How will the legislators make the case that President Obama is hurting women? Let's listen in!</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.45am:</span> Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) begins the <strong>Romney conference call</strong> by saying Hilary Rosen's comment was \"insulting.\" Ayotte has two kids. </p><p>\"Women have faced massive job losses under this administration,\" Ayotte says. \"I'm really worried about what we're leaving for the next generation in terms of the massive debt we've incurred under this president. ... I know that women, myself included, are concerned about what we're leaving for children.\"</p><p>There is an accidental conflict between the points the Romney camp is making this morning. Those points are: one, it's insulting to say that staying at home doesn't count as work. Two, not enough women are able to get jobs outside the home.</p><p>Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers on now. She says the \"war on women\" supposedly being waged by Republicans is a myth, the creation of the Democrats. \"What's really going on is a war on reality by the Democrats,\" she says.</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.49am:</span> Waiting for someone on the <strong>Romney conference call</strong> to name an Obama policy that has hurt women's economic prospects. They're holding him responsible for jobs lost during the recession. That's an argument to be made. But it's a leap from there to get to \"Obama has been bad for women.\"</p><p>The argument the Obama camp has to make, that Romney's policies are antagonistic to women, is more concrete. Romney supports the overturning of Roe v. Wade. He wants to abolish Planned Parenthood. And he doesn't want employers to be required to cover contraception as part of their health insurance.</p><p>Those issues aren't the most important for every women voter. But they're part of the reason for that double-digit gap between the president and Romney among women.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">11.58am:</span> Let's drop <strong>that call</strong> for a moment (a moment that lasts forever). The point participants are making is that what Democratic adviser Hilary Rosen said about Ann Romney not working was offensive. </p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>I apparently am on the \"Hillary Rosen speaks for Barack Obama\" conference call.</p><p>— John Dickerson (@johndickerson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johndickerson/status/190467800144429056\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T15:53:56+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><!-- Block 10 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.04pm:</span> Former Republican primary frontrunner <strong>Herman Cain</strong> is still making commercials, and they're still gonzo.

The Obama strategy in the general election is to paint Romney as a benighted conservative whom no Independent in his/her right mind would vote for. Highlighting Romney's moderate record as governor would be counterproductive. So the thinking went.</p><p>As if on cue, the Obama camp has released a three-minute video commemorating Romney's work on his state health care law.</p><p>The video depicts Romney as having executed an astoundingly brash about-face on health care reform. The MIT expert who helped write both laws is interviewed. Others express disbelief that the candidate has changed his tune so dramatically.</p><p>Maybe the Obama camp can make both arguments at once. Romney is an arch-conservative. He is also a political opportunist. Apparently the president's reelection campaign has decided the messages work together.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">12.45pm:</span> <strong>Mitt Romney</strong> has said again and again on the stump that he gleans special insight into the hearts and minds of women voters through the faithful reports of his wife, Ann, after she speaks with them. </p><p>Some find the assertion to be balanced on a knife edge between absurd and sexist.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Also, because I can't get over this, please imagine female candidate saying, \"My husband talks to men and tells me about their concerns.\"</p><p>— Kate Harding (@KateHarding) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KateHarding/status/190447334591696896\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T14:32:37+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><!-- Block 15 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.13pm:</span> <strong>From the comments</strong> (where we have invited you to take the measure of Rosengate, which you were going to anyway): A point by bloopie2:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/75056.html\">Politico has an article by John F. Harris, </a>noting that both Barack Obama and Mitt Romney are \"exceptionally self-contained, self-disciplined, self-motivated\" men, whose minds \"gravitate to rationality and logic—both of whom have expressed disdain for the disorder and surliness that pervade modern governance.\" </p><p>His point, it seems, is that for all the bombast and extremism of the current electoral process, come January we will have a President who is neither bombastic nor extreme (in many ways, not all, obviously). On the other hand, some of the Presidents he cites who are not like O and Mitt (Clinton, Johnson) were quite effective in their own ways.</p></blockquote><p>A point well made. One of the sharpest contrasts between the Obama presidency and that of George W. Bush has been in the leaders' rhetorical styles. Where Bush could be pugnacious, Obama projects tranquility; where Bush used the language of \"us vs. them,\" Obama talks a lot of kumbaya. Yet the tenor of national politics has not leavened under Obama. We still all hate each other, it seems. </p><p>The conclusion being that the president does not set the tone of the national politics. The question then being: who does?</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.37pm:</span> CNN reports that <strong>Hilary Rosen</strong> has taken a hitherto unprecedented step in the long saga of her remarks disparaging Ann Romney and their fallout: She has apologized.</p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Rosen: \"I apologize to Ann Romney and anyone else who was offended. \"Live with @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wolfblitzercnn\">wolfblitzercnn</a> today on @<a href=\"https://twitter.com/CNNSitRoom\">CNNSitRoom</a> 4p-6p.</p><p>— Patricia DiCarlo (@pdicarlocnn) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pdicarlocnn/status/190493199595352065\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T17:34:52+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><p>So this means it's all over with, right?</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">2.36pm:</span> Now for today's most likeable, un-likeliest of stories: <strong>Newt Gingrich and Fox News</strong> are at war over the channel's coverage of the candidate.

In our experience, Callista and I both believe CNN is less biased than Fox this year.</p><p>\"We are more likely to get neutral coverage out of CNN than we are of Fox, and we're more likely to get distortion out of Fox. That's just a fact.\"</p><p>Fox hit back in a strongly personal attack. A spokesman said: \"This is nothing other than Newt auditioning for a windfall of a gig at CNN – that's the kind of man he is.

His response: \"listen, I have no intention of leaving here.\"</p><p>— Robert Costa (@robertcostaNRO) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertcostaNRO/status/190541892772044800\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T20:48:21+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><p><br /><em></em></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Christie says he doesn't have \"personality\" for veep.... BUT he is willing to \"listen\" if the party/Romney needs him</p><p>— Robert Costa (@robertcostaNRO) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertcostaNRO/status/190542147647324160\" data-datetime=\"2012-04-12T20:49:22+00:00\">April 12, 2012</a></p></blockquote><p>We actually were quite impressed with how athletically Christie beat back the Republican faithful begging him to run for president back in September and October of 2011. His \"No\" in that instance was much more forceful: \"Now is not my time.\"</p><p><em></em></p><!-- Block 26 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">5.15pm:</span> Who has yet to comment on <strong>Rosengate</strong>? Are there any <em>presidents</em> in the audience? Wait, you there, down in front with the double-digit lead among women voters in the 2012 presidential race according to a recent ABC News poll. <strong>Barack Obama</strong>!</p><p>The president took a question about Rosen-gate today from Bruce Aune of ABC's Cedar Rapids affiliate KCRG. <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/obama-rejects-rosens-comments-on-ann-romney/\">Mary Bruce</a> writes up the interview. <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/obama-rejects-rosens-comments-on-ann-romney/\">Click through</a> to check out the video. Here's what the president said:</p><blockquote class=\"quoted\"><p>Here's what I know. That there's no tougher job than being a mom. And, when I think about what Michelle's had to do, and when I think about my own mom, a single mother raising me and my sister, that's work. And so anybody who would argue otherwise probably needs to rethink their statement.</p><p>More broadly, I don't have a lot of patience for commentary about the spouses of political candidates. My general view is, those of us in public life, we're fair game. Our families are civilians. I haven't met Mrs. Romney, but she seems like a very nice women who's supportive of her family and supportive of her husband. I don't know that she volunteered for this job, so, you know, we don't need to be directing comments at them. I think me and Governor Romney are going to have more than enough to argue about over the course of this campaign.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 27 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">5.51pm:</span> We're going to call it a wrap on today's <strong>politics live blog</strong>; may we express our appreciation for your attention and input. Here's what happened:</p><p>• <strong>The trespasses of Hilary Rosen, a Democratic strategist, took over the national political discourse like a giant viscous blob of green God-knows-what.</strong> What did she do wrong? We're not even sure anymore. Did she say she was sorry? We earnestly believe that she did.</p><p>• <strong>Ann Romney acquitted herself nicely, in our judgment, in an appearance on Fox News in which she spoke of her husband Mitt Romney's respect for women </strong>and lifelong habit of seeking their good counsel. She also opened <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/AnnDRomney\">a Twitter account </a>which has now racked up 25,519 followers after only two Tweets. Those are Sheen numbers. </p><p>•<strong> The gender gap in salaries and employment in America is shrinking, my colleague Dominic Rushe noted.</strong> Last month, the unemployment rate was 8.3% for men and 8.1% for women. In 1979, women ages 25 to 34 earned 68% what their male counterparts did. By 2010, they earned 91%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Not there yet, employers.</p><p>• <strong>Newt Gingrich and Fox News got into a slapfight that we fear cannot but end unprettily.</strong> Gingrich said Fox was about as fair and balanced as a two-legged stool (to paraphrase). Fox said Newt was just trying out for a CNN job. Stay tuned.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=US+politics&k=US+elections+2012&k=World+news&k=United+States&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&k=Republicans\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Hilary+Rosen+chastised+for+attacking+Ann+Romney+-as+it+happened+Article+1730504&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=US+politics%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CWorld+news%2CUS+news%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CRepublicans+%28US%29%2CDemocrats%2CBarack+Obama+%28News%29%2CMitt+Romney+%28News%29%2CNewt+Gingrich&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Tom+McCarthy+in+New+York&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730504&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/12/hillary-rosen-ann-romney-live|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|5dbb9548b63b0122521f4edf637753f6af72eb43 -->",

          "body": "<p>\"It's been 40 years since I had a No 1 hit&nbsp;with Puppy Love,\" <strong>Donny Osmond</strong> told listeners to his new Sunday night show on <a href=\"http://www.smoothradio.co.uk/shows-presenters/donny-osmond-on-sunday-evenings/1eb4d\" title=\"Smooth Radio\">Smooth Radio</a>. Before playing the track, he recalled singing the song live on stage in the early days: \"The girls started screaming and I forgot the&nbsp;words.\"</p><p>The four-hour show from Las Vegas could do with a little more of this layer of him reminiscing about his career. Otherwise, it's several relaxed tracks played back to back, with gaps so long between Donny's links that you start wondering what on earth he might be doing during the music, and a smattering of slightly odd entertainment stories. The first was Kate Winslet's reaction (\"Make it stop! Make it stop!\") on seeing herself in 3D in Titanic.</p><p>Musically, the show suits its slot (8pm-midnight) with its easy-going classics, and Donny is certainly smooth enough to feel at home on the station. \"I beat Celine Dion as best singer in Las Vegas,\" he said of a recent award before playing some Dion. He talked about a Chinese fad for pillow fights to de-stress, then pretended to write \"Marie\" on a pillowcase (\"Hey, Marie, can I see you for a minute?\"). It's all very slickly done, but more chat from Donny would improve things. One unintended giggle: the commercial break after Puppy Love featured a rather neatly placed ad for dog food.</p><p><strong>Annie Nightingale's </strong><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01fcnhh\" title=\"Eternal Jukebox\"><strong>Eternal Jukebox</strong></a> (Radio 2), a one-off show for Easter Monday, was a far livelier affair, crackling with fidgety energy. \"Hello, hi, hey!\" said Nightingale after the opening track: Killer Queen. From there, she explained, the idea was that each track would spark a connection from \"the jukebox in my head\". The result was a meander through beautiful music – Prefab Spout, This Mortal Coil, Ian Dury, Fleetwood Mac, Bob Marley – yoked together with much style and verve by Nightingale. It was a huge treat for those of us who grew up listening to her Sunday night show, but who aren't majorly drawn to the grime and dubstep she plays on Radio 1.

          "headline": "Fox News hits back at 'bitter' Newt Gingrich over claims of campaign bias",
          "body": "<p>Fox News has attacked the struggling Republican presidential candidate, Newt Gingrich, after an outburst in which he blamed the network for the failure of his campaign and claimed it was biased in favour of Mitt Romney.</p><p>The channel, where Gingrich had a contract before hitting the campaign trail, dismissed the accusations and claimed his criticism of the network was motivated by a desire for a job at rival CNN.</p><p>Gingrich's outspoken criticism of Fox came at a meeting in Delaware on Wednesday with Tea Party activists.<br /><a href=\" http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/04/12/gingrich_unloads_on_fox_news_in_private_meeting___113818.html\"><br />According to the RealClearPolitics website</a>, which was given access to the meeting, Gingrich said: \"I think Fox has been for Romney all the way through. In our experience, Callista and I both believe CNN is less biased than Fox this year.</p><p>\"We are more likely to get neutral coverage out of CNN than we are of Fox, and we're more likely to get distortion out of Fox. That's just a fact.\"</p><p>Fox hit back in a strongly personal attack. In a statement provided to the Guardian, it said: \"This is nothing other than Newt auditioning for a windfall of a gig at CNN – that's the kind of man he is. Not to mention that he's still bitter about the fact that we terminated his contributor contract.\"</p><p>While Gingrich has chosen to remain in the Republican race after the exit of Rick Santorum on Tuesday, he has won only two states so far and is trailing well behind Romney. He is also struggling financially, having accumulated huge debts during the campaign and suffered the indignity of seeing a $500 cheque to the Utah Republican party bounce.</p><p>Gingrich is campaigning this week in Delaware, one of several states where he hopes he can benefit from Santorum's departure.</p><p>At the Delaware meeting, he said he was working on the assumption that Rupert Murdoch, the chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, Fox's parent company, had thrown his support behind Romney.</p><p>\"I assume it's because Murdoch at some point  said, 'I want Romney', and so 'fair and balanced' became 'Romney'. And there's no question that Fox had a lot to do with stopping my campaign because such a high percentage of our base watches Fox.\"</p><p>Fox, led by Roger Ailes, has been the main media forum for the Republican candidates. Fox insists it has been fair and balanced. In the initial stages of the primary and caucus season, it even seemed to be more hostile toward Romney than the other candidates. But by March, Santorum was complaining, on Fox, about bias.</p><p>Santorum said Romney enjoyed a huge advantage in terms of money, organisation and media coverage. \"He's had Fox News shilling for him every day,\" Santorum said.</p><p>Gingrich is to attend the White House correspondents' dinner at the end of the month, but as a guest of CNN, not Fox. He insisted he was largely indifferent to the views of journalists: \"They know I don't care about their opinions. I don't go to their cocktail parties. I don't go to their Christmas parties. The only press events I go to are interesting dinners when the wife insists on it, so we're going to go to the White House correspondents' dinner because she wants to. And we're actually going to go to CNN's table, not Fox.\"</p><p>He expressed disappointment that former colleagues Fox, with whom he had a contract until he officially joined the Republican race, had apparently written him off last summer.</p><p>Gingrich enjoyed massive media coverage when he won the South Carolina primary in January, but interest dipped after he failed to win Florida the same month. Since then, coverage has gradually evaporated, with no print journalists any longer attached full-time to coverage of his campaign. </p><p>In the meeting in Delaware, according to the RealClearPolitics report, he expanded his criticism of the media beyond Fox, in particular columnist George Will, whom he accused of personal jealousy.</p><p>\"In the case of Will, I was on [George] Stephanopoulos on Sunday morning with him, and it was kind of a 'You're not allowed to run for office – I mean, if you could run for office, why am I not running for office?' \" Gingrich said. \"And it's almost like they were personally offended. You know, 'This can't be real', and 'How can this guy go do that?'</p><p>\"I got that reaction from Will a few years back about writing a book, because I'm supposed to be a politician. He's supposed to be the writer. Well, I've now written 24 books, and 13 of them are New York Times bestsellers. I mean, there's a morning when George ought to just get over it.\"</p><p>As well as criticising the media, Gingrich attacked the Republican party, describing it as \"inarticulate\". He added: \"The Republican party is a managerial party that doesn't like to fight, doesn't like to read books.\"</p><p>He described Delaware as his best chance of a win on April 24.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Newt+Gingrich&k=Fox+News&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&k=US+elections+2012&k=United+States&k=US+politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Fox+News+hits+back+at+%27bitter%27+Newt+Gingrich+over+claims+of+campaign+bias+Article+1730661&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Newt+Gingrich%2CFox+News%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CUS+politics%2CCNN%2CMedia%2CRupert+Murdoch+%28Media%29%2CRepublicans+%28US%29%2CNews+Corporation+%28Media%29%2CTea+Party+movement%2CDelaware+%28News%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730661&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/12/newt-gingrich-complains-fox-news|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|2a61694f2a539a691a43c4cacc299ed8e88df40c -->",

MacFarlane has been suspended.</p><p>Four days later, and after a series of further disclosures, Hogan-Howe <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/03/met-police-commissioner-report-racist-behaviour\" title=\"\">urged his staff</a> to report inappropriate behaviour by colleagues, saying he was \"shocked\" by the revelations and adding: \"I will not stand for any racism or racists.\"</p><p>The decision to refer eight new cases to the IPCC was taken after an internal \"review\" – and amid growing public concern over the claims of racist language and abuse of black suspects.</p><p>Keith Vaz MP, chairman of the committee, said: \"This is an opportunity to ask the commissioner about the steps he has taken to drive out racism from the Met and to restore confidence in our police service. I welcome the decision taken by the Metropolitan Police to have these incidents investigated thoroughly, and the commissioner's strong words to the force about tackling racism within it. However, these strong words must be backed up with action. It is imperative that there is zero tolerance to racism within the police.\"</p><p>He added: \"Members of the committee have expressed their concerns about the most recent allegations of racism that have surfaced in the last two weeks. We hope the commissioner will be able to update the committee on the action that he has taken.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Metropolitan+police&k=Bernard+Hogan-Howe&k=London&k=Police&k=UK+news&k=Independent+Police+Complaints+Commission\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Met+police+chief+to+face+MPs+over+racism+scandal+Article+1730601&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=Metropolitan+police%2CBernard+Hogan-Howe%2CLondon+%28News%29%2CPolice+and+policing%2CUK+news%2CIPCC+%28Independent+Police+Complaints+Commission%29%2CPolitics%2CRace+issues+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Paul+Lewis&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730601&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/12/met-police-chief-mps-racism-scandal|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|b773008c39ae3ba3fbe643ba5f7c0c1f2e469df9 -->",

          "body": "<h2>THE COM IS ON</h2><p>And so to Anfield, where Liverpool's owners have bolted the stable door at the half-past eleventh hour just after the horse boarded that ship that sailed. Yep, after signing exactly 0.4 good players in his time at Liverpool, director of football Damien Comolli has been ushered to the door marked \"Do one\" and been given a big boot in the derriere. Despite wearing clever glasses, Comolli failed to spot that five good games for Newcastle didn't make Andy Carroll worth £35m; a few good crosses for Villa didn't make Stewart Downing Steve Guppy; and being fat didn't make Charlie Adam Matt Le Tissier. Oh, and Jordan Henderson.</p><p></p><p>Jordan Henderson.</p><p></p><p>Still, although some of Comolli's signings were a bit Sebastian Coates, it's harsh to blame the whole thing on him. Because while some his ideas were a bit Doni, nobody made John W Henry write out those transfer cheques. \"Everyone who has come into the club since Damien has been here was of my choice. Once I made the choice who I wanted Damien went away and did a fantastic job of bringing them in,\" said Mr Ken today, checking furiously to see if any referees were responsible for eating the last Twirl in the fridge.</p><p></p><p>Now it should be remembered that Mr Ken has got Liverpool to the FA Cup semi-finals and won Tin Pot this season but the Fiver can't help feeling Comolli's sacking could be a shot across the bows from Liverpool's owners – bad news for some at Anfield if their poor league form continues. There is hope for Liverpool: if they need to offload any of Comolli's signings at vastly invested prices, Roman Abramovich is rumoured to have his chequebook out this summer.</p><p></p><h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2><p>\"I will never say we can't win the league if there is still a chance. That is not my life, never\" – Roberto Mancini, Tuesday 10 April before Manchester City face West Brom and Manchester United face Wigan</p><p></p><p>\"The title race is finished … five points is too much\" – Roberto Mancini, Wednesday 11 April after Manchester City beat West Brom and Manchester United lose to Wigan</p><p></p><h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2><p>\"In response to Mike Wilner (yesterday's Fiver), once some local youth pushed a firework through my bathroom window, where it rolled into the pan and exploded. We were a house full of male students so, yes, the lid was up. Anyway, all that remained of said toilet was an inch of pipe protruding from the floor, a cloud of porcelain dust, and a huge puddle on the floor. So I can confirm it is possible to destroy a toilet with fire while also flooding the washroom. And it's a good job that Woy was working in Sweden at the time, or I might now be getting suspicious.\" – Mark Ireland</p><p></p><p>\"Regarding Mr Wilner's letter yesterday inquiring into how a toilet could be on fire while a bathroom was being flooded, he'll just have to take my word for it when told that the toilet seat (and nearby toilet paper) is definitely flammable and sometimes just turning on the faucet taps before running out the door is the only sensible solution\" – Jeff McCrum</p><p></p><p>Send your letters to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@guardian.co.uk\" title=\"\">the.boss@guardian.co.uk</a>.

There was a tense time between them but now all is calm.\"</p><p></p><p>Shanghai Shenhua have added Nicolas Anelka to their coaching staff. \"The foreign players are in urgent need of high-quality training [so] we have made the decision to replace some members of the coaching staff,\" parped the club.</p><p></p><p>Dave Whelan says Roberto Martinez will stay at Wigan even if the club are relegated, possibly due to an accident with some industrial strength adhesive. \"I've always said Roberto will leave Wigan because he's destined for one of the big clubs in England or Europe,\" said the Latics chairman. \"When that time comes and he wants to leave, I will support him. But at present, Roberto is glued to Wigan.\"</p><p></p><h2>STILL WANT MORE?</h2><p>Videos you thought you'd never see, No1 in a series of one: <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/video/2012/apr/15/joey-barton-lucian-freud-art-video\" title=\"\">Joey Barton discusses Lucian Freud</a>.</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/audio/2012/apr/12/football-weekly-extra-podcast-wigan-manchester-united\" title=\"\">Football Weekly Extraaaaaaa is here</a> featuring a dash of Sean Ingle, a hint of John Ashdown and pinch of Paul MacInnes</p><p></p><p>Bild reckon Bayern Munich threw the title away with their defeat to Dortmund but Raphael Honigstein is a smart bloke and knows <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/apr/12/bayern-munich-borussia-dortmund-bundesliga\" title=\"\">that ain't the full story</a></p><p></p><p>Lecce's season has had more twists than a piece of fusilli col buco, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/apr/12/sensation-catania-lecce-serie-a\" title=\"\">reckons Paolo Bandini</a></p><p></p><p>Save up your saliva for slobbering all over the greatest goal in Ligue 1 history, a Dennis Bergkamp compilation and a Messi impersonation all oh which feature in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2012/apr/12/classic-you-tube-best-sport-clips\" title=\"\">this week's episode of Classic YouTube</a></p><p></p><p>When the dust settles will United or City be victorious? <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2012/apr/12/manchester-united-city-premier-league\" title=\"\">Jamie Jackson gives you 10 clues</a></p><p></p><h2>SIGN UP TO THE FIVER</h2><p>Want your very own copy of our free tea-timely(ish) email sent direct to your inbox?

          "headline": "Converting audio CDs into digital files",
          "body": "<p><em>You wrote in <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/askjack/2011/may/06/ask-jack-scanner-photographs\">another column</a>: 'My preferred strategy for scanning things (or ripping CDs), is to do the job so well that it never has to be done again.' Please could you share your thoughts on the best way to do this?</em><br /><strong>Michael Stevens</strong><br /><br />Converting or \"ripping\" an audio CD into a digital file is a time-consuming process, and there are at least two sensible options. The first is to make a perfect copy using a lossless system such as <a href=\"http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html\">FLAC</a> (Free Lossless Audio Codec). The second is to make a copy that is so good that you will never be able to hear the difference. I chose the second option, and encoded tracks in 320kbps MP3.</p><p>FLAC captures all the information in the recording, but it has two significant disadvantages: it produces large files, and not all portable music players can handle it. (Unfortunately, both Apple and Microsoft have their own lossless formats.) The MP3 codec, by contrast, delivers smaller files that almost every device – PC, phone, MP3 player, CD player etc – can play. It's the closest thing we have to a universal music format.</p><p>I could have used a lower bit rate than 320kbps (actually VBR: variable bit rate), and I can't reliably hear the difference between lossless and 196kbps MP3 files. However, using a higher bit rate should mean that when I buy better equipment -– such as a high-end MP3 player – it won't expose problems that were masked before. As you may have found, a good quality hi-fi stack and studio monitors can reveal flaws in music files that are inaudible when using a mainstream MP3 player with headphones or earbuds. This applies to CDs as well.</p><p>I could also have used a lower bit rate with the AAC file format, because it is more efficient than MP3. AAC makes a real difference at low bit rates, especially below 128kbps, but it doesn't make any practical difference at 256kbps and higher bit rates. I decided against AAC because it was far less widely supported than MP3, because there are several versions of AAC, and because I noticed most people like me were using MP3. (If a lot of people have the same problem, someone will produce a fix.)</p><p>When I wrote a feature about this, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2007/apr/12/newmedia.guardianweeklytechnologysection1\">Finding the music format of the future</a>, way back in 2007, I was bullish about AAC. Apple had just decided to offer unprotected 256kbps AAC files alongside its DRM-protected 128kbps AAC files, which I wouldn't use even if they were free. However, AAC has not made the sort of progress I expected, and I haven't regretted choosing MP3.</p><p>So, what's the best way to rip your files? This topic has been debated in considerable depth for at least two decades by people who are much more qualified than I am, so I decided to adopt what many experts considered the best approach. That was to rip CDs using Exact Audio Copy (EAC) software and the open source LAME, following one of the guides at the Hydrogen Audio website: <a href=\"http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=EAC_and_Lame\">EAC and LAME</a>. (The name stands recursively for Lame Aint an MP3 Encoder.)</p><p>I was interested to find that the results sounded better to someone who doesn't have a clue what a file format is, and has zero interest in the topic. I had shown my wife how to rip her own (classical) CDs on a Mac laptop using the iTunes defaults and left her to it: job done. A few days later, she got me to rerip them using my system because she wasn't happy with the sound quality.</p><p>Hydrogen Audio has quite a few <a href=\" http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=\"Category:Guides\"\">Guides</a>, including nine that use EAC. But if you decide to use <a href=\"http://wiki.hydrogenaudio.org/index.php?title=CDex_and_FLAC\">CDex and FLAC</a>, for example, there's a guide for that.</p><p>Hard drive sizes have grown over the past half dozen years, so we now have 750GB and 1TB drives where we used to have 120GB or 150GB drives. This means the extra size of FLAC files – which can be roughly half the size of the original WAV files – is less of an issue. For comparison, a 24-bit FLAC version of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon (1973) takes up 239MB whereas my 320kbps MP3 version takes up 71MB. </p><p>You may find lossless files take up too much space, but it depends how many CDs you want to rip.</p><p>Although not every device will play FLAC, you can use these files to produce MP3, AAC, WMA or other lossy formats for mobile devices. The lossless rip becomes the master copy of the CD, so you never have to rip it again. If you need 320kbps MP3 files for a good quality MP3 player and/or 128kbps versions for a mobile phone, you can make them whenever you like.</p><p>This is not the same as \"transcoding\" between different lossy formats, such as MP3 or WMA and AAC. That leads to a loss in quality, and is always a bad idea.</p><p>I didn't rip things to FLAC, back in the day, and I'm not entirely sure I'd do it now. But if you don't have one or two decades of music files or want to make a fresh start, it's certainly worth considering.</p><p>Also, if we are ever going to move to a system that provides better-than-CD quality, FLAC is by far the most popular format. <a href=\"http://www.linnrecords.com/catalogue.aspx?format=studio\">Linn Records</a> sells 24-bit studio master recordings in FLAC format, and Apple Corps and EMI released a limited edition of The Beatles back catalogue in 24-bit FLAC and 320kbps MP3 on an Apple-shaped USB stick.</p><p>The problem with FLAC files is that Apple iPods won't play them. </p><p>This isn't a practical problem at the moment: they consume so much space, you probably wouldn't want to play FLAC files on a mobile device. However, people who are solidly in the iPod/iPhone/iTunes camp should consider using ALAC, Apple's Lossless Audio Codec, instead. Most iPods with recent firmware can play ALAC files, it's used in Airtunes, and Apple has now made the format open source. Lossless is lossless so ALAC files should sound identical to FLAC files (as long as you have <a href=\"http://www.hydrogenaudio.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=52057\">iTunes' Soundcheck switched off during playback</a>). It's really a matter of convenience.</p><p>Of course, Macs can play FLAC files, and Mac users can convert FLAC (and other) files into other formats using, for example, the open source <a href=\"http://sbooth.org/Max/\">Max</a>. If you are going to transcode audio files for mobile use, it doesn't matter whether you convert them from ALAC or FLAC.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Technology&k=Digital+music+and+audio&k=Digital+rights+management&k=Software&k=Computing\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Converting+audio+CDs+into+digital+files+%7C+Ask+Jack+Article+1730545&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Technology%2CDigital+music+and+audio+%28Technology%29%2CDRM+%28Technology%29%2CSoftware+%28Technology%29%2CComputing+%28Technology%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Jack+Schofield&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730545&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/askjack/2012/apr/12/ask-jack-digital-audio|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|8025530a487654864cc76bbfb12d95d5686bced5 -->",

The new proposal would form part of the forthcoming victims and witnesses bill.</p><p>Ministers are also considering levying a victims' surcharge on criminals, on top of existing compensation orders, to create a fund that would provide help to all victims of crime. MacAskill said: \"The police treatment centres put right the damage done by criminal assaults largely with money raised by donations from the victims. This is the reverse of fair. Instead it is right to expect criminals who assault police to contribute to payment for this treatment. We believe proceeds from penalties should be paid into a fund for officers.</p><p>\"This is a win-win situation which will result in restitution for offenders and recuperation for victims of crime.\"</p><p>At the moment, anyone convicted of assaulting a police officer in the line of duty faces a fine, imprisonment, a community payback order or a compensation order.

          "body": "<p>John Derbyshire, a columnist for the <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/295514/parting-ways-rich-lowry\" title=\"\">National Review</a>, wrote an <a href=\"http://takimag.com/article/the_talk_nonblack_version_john_derbyshire/#axzz1rI2sQ2I7\" title=\"\">essay</a> last week implying that black people were intellectually inferior to white people: \"Only one out of six blacks is smarter than the average white.\" Derbyshire pulled these figures from a region near his large intestine.</p><p>One of Derbyshire's claims, however, is true: that there are no black winners of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal\" title=\"\">Fields medal</a>, the \"Nobel prize of mathematics\". According to Derbyshire, this is \"civilisationally consequential\". Derbyshire implies that the absence of a black winner means that black people are incapable of genius. In reality, black mathematicians face career-retarding racism that white Fields medallists never encounter. Three stories will suffice to make this point.</p><p>The first involves Saunders Mac Lane, one of the most influential algebraists of the last century. He co-authored, with Garrett Birkhoff, a text that enthralled me as a first-year undergraduate. I first encountered <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_%28order%29\" title=\"\">lattice theory</a>, which for a long time I loved more than anything in life, in that book. In 1951, Mac Lane was president of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA). Vanderbilt University hosted an MAA conference, and three black mathematicians wished to attend the conference's banquet. They were barred and <a href=\"http://sections.maa.org/southeastern/maase/section/minority.pdf\" title=\"\">Mac Lane refused to take a stand</a>: Vanderbilt University was in racially segregated Tennessee, and he did not want to offend his hosts.</p><p>The second story involves one of the few black mathematicians whom white mathematicians acknowledge as great – or, I should say, \"black American mathematicians\", since obviously <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid\" title=\"\">Euclid</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes#Life\" title=\"\">Eratosthenes</a> and other African mathematicians outshone Europe's brightest stars for millennia. His name was David Blackwell. I first met Blackwell in 1995, in the common room of Berkeley's maths department, one of the few times two black people had ever been in the room. Blackwell obtained his PhD in mathematics when he was only 22.</p><p>While he had a fellowship to work at the Institute for Advanced Study, the American home of Einstein and the other-worldly logician <a href=\"http://www.ostina.org/content/view/1155/510/\" title=\"\">Kurt Gödel</a>, nearby <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/education/17blackwell.html\" title=\"\">Princeton University refused to allow Blackwell</a> to attend lectures because he was black. Although he later became the first black member of the National Academy of Sciences (with a colleague saying, \"he would come into a field that had been well studied and find something really new that was remarkable\"), the University of California at Berkeley's maths department would not hire Blackwell on account of his race (a European later asked Blackwell to join the statistics department).</p><p>My third story is not that in 2002, after I wrote an article about Confederate remembrance, supporters of the Ku Klux Klan <a href=\"http://www.wienerzeitung.at/themen_channel/wz_reflexionen/zeitgenossen/34836_Jonathan-Farley.html\" title=\"\">sent me death threats</a>, forcing me to leave my home and my permanent job at Vanderbilt University. Others, such as Barrett Brown <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/dec/26/american-civil-war-usa\" title=\"\">in the Guardian</a> and  <a href=\"http://latticetheory.net/media/pdf/Hot_Fat_Clouded_Excerpt.pdf\" title=\"\">in his book Hot, Fat, and Clouded</a>, have recounted how little support I got from the university authorities during this ordeal.</p><p></p><p>The last tale is not either that, when I was a professor there, police at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology detained me on suspicion of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/nov/07/dnaofthekkk\" title=\"\">being a bank robber</a>.</p><p></p><p>No, my final story is that, in 2009, I was an invited speaker at the Counterterrorism Research Lab (CRL), along with US president Barack Obama's soon-to-be <a href=\"http://static.sdu.dk/mediafiles/Files/Om_SDU/Fakulteterne/Teknik/Diverse/CTRWorkshop.pdf\" title=\"\">cybersecurity tsar</a>, Howard Schmidt. At one point, a fellow American brought up the civil war, and said – angrily – that the pro-black-slavery Confederacy had the right to secede. I objected as politely as I could. The man exploded, firing off a chain of expletives in front of the 80-person audience. I was blamed for his outburst, and a job offer that had been previously discussed disappeared (it had happened before, when prospective employers withdrew offers after hearing about the Klan attacks). Along the same lines, a senior officer of the <a href=\"http://latticetheory.net/media/pdf/Personal_Reflections_on_Beauty_and_Terror_Page_388.pdf\" title=\"\">National Academies</a> ceased communication with me when <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2001/nov/17/highereducation.uk\" title=\"\">he saw my essay</a> in the Guardian about racism.</p><p></p><p>Before I was 30, I had solved decades-old problems posed by the world-renowned <a href=\"http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2004/aandh-0519.html\" title=\"\">Richard Stanley</a> at MIT. At 32, the Klan attack sidetracked me. I probably never would have won, but one must be under 40 to win a Fields, and I have not had time to focus on Fields medal-worthy pursuits. Other black people fared likewise.</p><p></p><p>Losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in income pales besides <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57401619-504083/author-of-stand-your-ground-law-george-zimmerman-should-probably-be-arrested-for-killing-trayvon-martin/\" title=\"\">being shot for Skittles</a>, so I do not complain. Instead, I let Harvard's Stephen Jay Gould reply to Derbyshire: \"Few tragedies can be more extensive than the stunting of life, few injustices deeper than the denial of an opportunity to strive or even to hope, by a limit imposed from without, but falsely identified as lying within.\" What gives me hope is that race relations are not what they were in 2002. The National Review fired Derbyshire. White people helped my career – specifically Birkhoff's student George Markowsky and Austria's Günter Pilz – but Blackwell refused to speak with me for even one minute: perhaps race is asymptotically approaching irrelevance.</p><p></p><p>At last.</p><p></p><p>• Professor Jonathan David Farley won the Harvard Foundation's Scientist of the Year medal in 2004</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Race+issues&k=Mathematics&k=World+news&k=United+States&k=Mathematics&k=Science\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Black+mathematicians%3A+the+kind+of+problems+they+wish+didn%27t+need+solving+%7C+Jonathan+Farley+Article+1729697&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=148491&c4=Race+issues+%28News%29%2CMathematics+%28Education+subject%29%2CWorld+news%2CUS+news%2CMathematics+%28science%29%2CScience%2CEducation&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Jonathan+Farley&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1729697&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/12/black-mathematicians-john-derbyshire-fields-medal|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|51d8ade897edeff2f5f193873e9a57faaea332d8 -->",

          "headline": "Apple readies Flashback malware removal tool: but how big is the risk?",
          "body": "<p>Apple says it will develop a tool to remove the Flashback malware reckoned to have infected more than 600,000 Macintosh computers worldwide, most recently via a flaw in Oracle's Java software, following the worst attacks against the platform in the past decade.</p><p>But in a <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5244\">brief document posted on Wednesday</a>, the company did not offer any advice on how users could find out whether their machine was infected, nor – aside from updating their software – how they could protect themselves against infection.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Apple has <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2012/apr/13/apple-flashback-java-malware-fix\">released the removal tool, for systems running Mac OSX 10.5 and 10.6.</a> Users of systems running earlier version are advised to disable Java.</p><p>(<strong>The security company <a href=\"http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002336.html\">F-Secure has instructions so that Mac users can discover whether they are infected</a>. <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/04/05/mac-flashback-trojan-check/\">Mashable also offers links to a pair of scripts</a> that will check Safari – though not other browsers – for infection.</strong>)</p><p>The first variants of Flashback appeared last September, masquerading as updates to Adobe's Flash player software. More recent variants exploited other flaws – notably in Java.</p><p>Once installed, the malware monitors network traffic to steal passwords and login details for various sites and systems, attempts to install itself as a root program able to access all users' files, and may also download other software from control servers silently. It could also organise infected machines into a botnet able to attack websites or, potentially, host fake websites and other unwanted content.</p><p>The latest version using the Java exploit meant users could be infected without taking any action via their browser if Java was enabled simply by navigating to an infected site. </p><p>A number of websites require Java to provide functionality. Although Java is not included in Mac OS X 10.7, aka Lion, which was released last year, anyone who had upgraded their system from an earlier version of the OS would have it, as would anyone who downloaded it to run programs such as Adobe's Creative Suite.</p><p>Crucially, Apple maintains its own version of Java, and had left the flaw unpatched for weeks: Oracle released a fix on 17 February, which was distributed to Windows users. </p><p>Brian Krebs, a security expert, <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/04/urgent-fix-for-zero-day-mac-java-flaw/\">comments</a> that Apple's lackadaisical (and often <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/11/apple-took-3-years-to-fix-finfisher-trojan-hole/\">plain puzzling</a>) response to patching dangerous security holes perpetuates the harmful myth that Mac users don't need to be concerned about malware attacks.</p><p>Krebs says: \"If you don't need Java, remove it from your system, whether you are a Mac or Windows user.\"</p><p>The extent of the outbreak makes the Flashback infection, which was first detected at the end of March by the Russian security firm Dr Web, by far the largest ever to hit the Mac OSX platform. In relative terms, it is at least equivalent to the <a href=\"http://mtc.sri.com/Conficker/\">Conficker outbreak on Windows</a>, which affected millions of PCs – though only affecting less than 1% of the total installed base. </p><p>In the second half of 2011, Apple Macintosh sales passed 5% of the total PC market for the first time in more than a decade; the <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1981717\">latest figures from Gartner</a> say that in the US, it achieved 10% of personal computer sales in the first quarter of the year. That may have led malware writers to target the platform with renewed vigour.</p><p>Neither Flasback's authors nor their location has become clear. In May 2011, Russian hackers targeted <a href=\"http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/what-a-mac-malware-attack-looks-like/3269?tag=content;siu-containerr\">Mac OS X, which was hit by a wave of infections</a> driven by a Trojan program called MacDefender – often spread via infected images in Google's image search. But the combination of a software update from Apple, and a <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/08/raid-reveals-evidence-of-chronopay-ties-to-macdefender-scareware.ars\">raid by Russian police</a> put paid to the short-lived attack.</p><p>Although a number of commentators forecast at the time of MacDefender that it was the beginning of a fresh wave of attacks against the Mac OS X platform, it didn't materalise. At the same time, companies including Microsoft have made renewed efforts to close down botnets and capture those behind aggressive malware.</p><p>John Welch, who administers several hundred Macs for the organisation where he works, discovered that a number of the machines were infected by forms of Flashback, although in many cases the installation failed; that in turn locked out users who tried to log onto the machines, because certain files that Flashback told the system to load were not present. (The organisation uses Sophos antivirus on its machines.</p><p>\"It seems that the programmers behind it simply found a better infection vector, and used it,\" Welch told the Guardian. \"I'm not *that* impressed with it, I've seen too many half-done attempts to infect a machine where the silly thing couldn't even install correctly, so I'm not sure it's really all that clever.\"</p><p>He thinks that the principal threat will continue to be from infected documents rather than the core OS – though, he says: \"... not because Mac OS X or UNIX are magically invulnerable. (There's a lot of magical thinking on this subject.) It's more because due to some well-intentioned, but poor decisions made by Microsoft decades ago, the path to infect Windows was an eight-lane highway vs the muddy goat trail that was Unix. However, if you move off the OS proper, it gets more common.\"</p><p>Most high-profile attacks in the past few years have come from infected files which use weaknesses in associated software: Adobe's PDF and Flash Player have become increasingly common targets on both the Windows and Mac platforms, while Microsoft's Office suite – of Word, Excel and Powerpoint – are also frequently targeted by hackers seeking to subvert systems. </p><p>\"If it runs code, it can be compromised and run malware,\" Welch notes. \"It's just a matter of how much brainpower and skill someone wants to put behind it. Given the kind of money malware is now generating, there is a lot of both involved.\"</p><p>But he does think Apple has been too slow to react. \"This is a problem for Apple, and one I hope goes away with [Steve] Jobs not running the company. He had some issues with communication. I think Apple needs to speed up its reaction to verified threats, and they need to stop treating everything like it's [as secret as] the next iPhone. Yes, some things do need a great deal of security, but patching a *Java security hole* is not one of them. I know it's easy to get into that 'MUST NEVER SAY ANYTHING UNTIL IT'S DONE' mentality, but this has burned Apple in the past. They've improved somewhat, but have a ways to go.\"</p><p>With Apple having made both Flash and Java optional installations on existing desktop systems, the \"attack surface\" for malware authors has lessened. Welch points out: \"Java is a useful tool that fixes certain problems better than other tools. It's no more necessary than any other language or runtime. </p><p>\"A huge percentage of malware attacks happen via email and websites, yet no one asks 'should we really be using email and browsing the web?' [The open source database] MySQL and [web scripting language] PHP are commonly attacked, and successfully; no one questions those tools, even though they are a common infection vector.</p><p>If Java is the best, or even an equally good tool for the job, I think one is silly to ignore it because 'it's an infection vector'. So is PDF. I don't see people advocating the end of PDF. Bagging on Java in this case is silly. I do like that Apple doesn't install it by default, which I think is a good idea. The need for it is not *common* over the entire population of computer users, so making it an optional install is not a bad idea at all.\"</p><p>Yet even with the latest infection, amounting to 1% of the estimated installed base of Macs, there aren't so far signs of a deluge of attacks against Macs. Between MacDefender in May of 2011, and Flashback between September and the present day, the amount of Mac-targeting malware remains remarkably low; while Graham Cluley of Sophos points out in \"<a href=\"http://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/10/03/mac-malware-history/\">a short history of Mac malware</a>\", the amount targeting the platform has trebled in the past three years – but that still only amounts to a couple of new attacks per year. And one piece of software identified as \"malware\", <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/2010/jun/02/mac-spyware-removed-premieropinion\">from PremierOpinion</a>, is arguably no such thing, but a user-sanctioned tracking system for web use. </p><p>Sophos does offer <a href=\"http://www.sophos.com/freemacav\">free antivirus software for Mac users</a> – though it's not available through the App Store (because Apple limits what can be sold through it; apparently antivirus software isn't allowed.) Graham Lee, formerly of Sophos, also points out that antivirus apps <strong>sold through the App Store</strong> can't do real-time scanning, because they aren't allowed to install kernel extensions – which means that new infections can't be caught as they happen, but only retrospectively. (<strong>Note:</strong> apps not installed via the App Store can install kernel extensions, and so can do real-time scanning - as Sophos AV does. Apologies for not clarifying this initially.)</p><p>The question now is whether the attacks will get worse – or if malware authors have other targets they can more profitably focus on. Whereas even five years ago the options for malware authors were simple – write something to attack Windows machines, or Macs; the potential rewards were over 19 times greater for the former – now there are almost as many smartphones (where Android apps have become an attractive source of revenue for some, using \"Trojan diallers\" which silently dial expensive numbers or transmit sender-pays text messages) and, increasingly, websites which have credit card details, or phishing sites that can capture login details for PayPal or for webmail accounts – where the latter can then be used to send out <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2011/aug/05/beware-hackers-take-over-gmail-account\">fake frantic messages claiming you've been mugged</a>, and asking for untraceable wire payments.</p><p>In short, Apple may actually have been fortunate enough to survive the riskiest time – when the desktop and laptop computer were the principal form for computing – as malware has moved to a cross-platform format in which phones, websites, databases and simple social engineering have become equally good methods for criminals to get access to personal and financial details. It doesn't though mean that the danger has passed. But while 600,000 machines infected is certainly a lot, it pales in comparison to the millions of credit cards compromised by the attack on Sony's PlayStation Network, or the <a href=\"http://krebsonsecurity.com/2012/03/mastercard-visa-warn-of-processor-breach/\">more recent hack of a US payments processor</a>. </p><p>In short: have antivirus, but the bigger threats are probably outside your computer.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Apple&k=Malware&k=Data+and+computer+security&k=Technology&k=Computing&k=Internet\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Apple+readies+Flashback+malware+removal+tool%3A+but+how+big+is+the+risk%3F+Article+1730384&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Apple+%28Technology%29%2CMalware%2CData+and+computer+security+%28safeguarding+computers+and+data+from+criminals%29%2CTechnology%2CComputing+%28Technology%29%2CInternet%2CSoftware+%28Technology%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Charles+Arthur&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730384&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/2012/apr/12/apple-flashback-malware-tool-risks|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|43dd9580dc2ff484294fdb147b5180e500075265 -->",

          "body": "<p>Scotland's cycle stunt team, <a href=\"http://www.mb7.com/theclan/\" title=\"\">The Clan</a>, have launched a competition to find a new member to join them on this summer's tour of events. The winning rider must be skilled, committed, fearless and, most importantly of all, female.</p><p></p><p>It's the second year in a row that The Clan, the only UK stunt cycling team to feature female riders, has run a competition to find a new female member. Last year, they had six entrants. This year, with more than a week still to go before the deadline, they already have 10 in the running for the £5,000 prize; a sign, say the organisers, of a growing interest in the sport, and cycling in general, among girls and women.</p><p></p><p>Since they formed in 2008 – <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/bike-blog/2011/feb/20/danny-macaskill-bike-tricks\" title=\"\">Danny MacAskill</a> was a founder member – The Clan have insisted on having female members for the majority of their shows, relying initially on recommendations from friends and acquaintances of the six-strong team.</p><p></p><p>The Clan manager, Iain Withers, says:</p><p><blockquote>\"It's important to have diversity in our team and especially to ensure a female rider is present to show all the girls out there riding is not just for boys. \"It comes from the vibe of our show, trying to convince people that cycling is cool and fun and exciting for everyone. We have employed female riders since year one.  We were going round schools for Cycling Scotland and there was a lot of research that made it quite clear that if girls are going to get into cycling they need female role models to look up to.  That's what started it off.<br /><br />\"We were a little bit daunted to go and find a female rider because it's such a male dominated area. We didn't know if there was anyone out there who would be willing and capable but we have been really lucky. There have been six girls who have now done our shows and really the lesson has been that the talent is out there but it is just hidden away This year we have already got 10 really strong entries, quite a diverse range of talent from BMX to mountain biking. It's very promising.\"<br /></blockquote></p><p></p><p>The group runs shows at national sports events and community galas across Scotland in May and June. This year, for the first time, they'll be holding a women's weekend for all competition entrants in early May so that they can train and practice together on custom-built ramps and in a foam pit designed to allow riders to crash without hurting themselves.</p><p></p><p>Age, says Withers, should be no barrier.</p><p></p><p>\"Last year, we had a very strong entry from a mountain biker who was 15 at the time. She can't do it this year because she has exams but she's a really talented rider. Our first rider, Lynne Aitchison, who has since moved to Canada, is in her mid-30s. You can be any age. If we get some granny flying through the air that would be good stuff.\"</p><p></p><p>Speaking from Whistler in British Columbia, Aitchison says The Clan's insistence on featuring female riders is crucial for promoting the sport as widely as possible.</p><p></p><p>\"Having a female member of The Clan has been a really good thing as far as getting the message across to young girls that it's not just about boys,\" she says. \"When we went round schools the girls thought I was the bee's knees because I was a girl and I was doing all the tricks as well.\"</p><p></p><p>Aitchison only got into cycling in her late 20s and was in her 30s when she joined The Clan.</p><p></p><p>\"I did martial arts for a long time but I got a bit sick of doing sports inside. I had a bunch of male friends who mountain biked and I thought I'd try it out and I was hooked. I found I kind of excelled at jumping. I did my first back flip when I was 31.</p><p></p><p>\"It was a little intimidating for me at first to ride with a bunch of pretty highly skilled guys. I was 30 years old and I didn't get into biking until my late 20s. The guys in The Clan are really down to earth, really nice guys. They're all about riding rather than the kudos of being a bit of a stunt cyclist.\"</p><p></p><p>Aitchison has also set up <a href=\"http://www.airmaiden.com/\" title=\"\">Air Maiden</a> the annual women-only bike skills event at Glentress in the Tweed Valley. She had noticed that she was often the only female at the freeride skills park despite the fact that more women were getting into mountain biking.</p><p></p><p>\"It's a really comfortable environment,\" she says. \"There are no guys there to intimidate the women. It's really encouraging of them and it's grown so much that we're turning them away.\"</p><p></p><p>Aitchison will be back in Scotland for The Clan's women-only weekend in May and to offer support and encouragement to the competition winner. As much as she might have wanted to be involved, there was no chance of her being able to enter the competition this year.</p><p></p><p>\"I have a seven-month old son and I'm pregnant with twins so I'm not going to be riding my bike for a while.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/environment&k=Cycling&k=Fitness&k=Life+and+style&k=Cycling&k=Sport&k=Scotland\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/environment/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/environment/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Cycle+stunt+team+launches+competition+to+find+new+female+member+%7C+Kirsty+Scott+Article+1730287&ch=Environment&c2=148491&c4=Cycling+%28Life+and+style%29%2CFitness+%28Life+and+style%29%2CLife+and+style%2CCycling+%28Sport%29%2CSport%2CScotland+%28News%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Kirsty+Scott&c7=12-Apr-12&c8=1730287&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: environment/bike-blog/2012/apr/12/the-clan-female-rider|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|fcf50889e6f322feaa5e4c926406679a5aaa7767 -->",

          "body": "<p>Florida senator Marco Rubio and Virginia governor Bob McDonnell have participated in the long-established ritual of ruling themselves out as running-mates for Mitt Romney, who on Wednesday enjoyed his first full day as undisputed Republican presidential candidate. </p><p>Rubio and McDonnell join a growing queue of Republicans who insist they do not want to be the Republican vice-presidential candidate – but they have to say that, concerned they would end up looking foolish if they express an interest and Romney fails to pick them.</p><p>McDonnell, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505267_162-57412286/mcdonnell-santorum-should-back-romney/\">interviewed on CBS on Wednesday</a>, said he was happy being governor of Virginia. \"I got the job held by Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry – governor of Virginia. Doesn't get any better than that,\" McDonnell said.</p><p>With Rick Santorum's departure from the race on Tuesday, speculation began in earnest over the last big vacancy of the 2012 campaign to be filled, even though Romney is unlikely to announce his choice for months. Learning from the mistakes of John McCain's team in 2008, Romney's team will ensure their choice, unlike Sarah Palin, will be thoroughly vetted.</p><p>Santorum has expressed interest in the post but his harsh criticism of Romney would be exploited by Democrats, repeatedly replayed in ads.\"I think Santorum probably is not going to be in line for the VP spot because it's just been too nasty and contentious,\" Bradley Blakeman, a politics professor at Georgetown University, <a href=\"http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Santorum-Blakeman-campaign-withdrawal/2012/04/10/id/435439\">told Newsmax</a>. \"I think that he certainly can serve in a Romney administration if they find the right place for him where he can be helpful.\"</p><p>Rubio is repeatedly cited as among the frontrunners because he is a Latino, a demographic group that Romney and other Republicans have alienated, and because he represents Florida, a swing state that could determine the outcome of the White House race. \"I'm not going to be the vice-president,\" Rubio said, a line he has been repeating since last summer.  </p><p>But if offered the post, it would be hard to resist a platform from which to launch a bid of his own for the presidency in 2016 or 2020.</p><p>Susana Martinez, the governor of New Mexico, is another prospective vice-presidential candidate, with the advantage of not only being from a Latino background but a woman, a demographic group with which Romney struggles compared with Obama. Martinez, like Rubio, has ruled out the job. \"It's humbling but I'm not interested,\" she told the Associated Press. </p><p>Much of the speculation focuses on issues such as gender, geography or ethnic background, working on the assumption that these will help bring in voters on the margin. But recent political history shows that presidential candidates have tended to buck this received wisdom, spectacularly so in the case of McCain in picking a running-mate from Alaska, which has almost no impact on the presidential race, and a woman who alienated women in droves.</p><p>Conservative commentator George Will, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/romney-needs-a-heavy-hitter-as-his-vice-president/2012/04/06/gIQAB0sVzS_story.html\">writing in the Washington Post</a>, noted that since the second world war, 10 presidential candidates have failed to win the home state of their vice-presidential running mates. He argued instead in favour of two candidates experienced in budgetary issues and adminstration, Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal or Paul Ryan, chairman of the House budget committee.</p><p>\"So Romney's running-mate should have intellectual firepower, born of immersion in policy complexities, sufficient to refute Obama's meretricious claims and derelictions of duty. Here are two excellent choices,\" Will writes.<br />Both Jindal and Ryan have ruled out being Romney's running-mate, as have New Jersey governor Chris Christie, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, and Ohio senator Rob Portman.</p><p>One of the few Republicans to publicly express an interest in the job is Herman Cain. Part of the reason may be that he, unlike others, have opted to say he would consider it is because he is a long shot, having been forced out of the Republican presidential race late last year amid allegations of sexual harassment.</p><p>Asked by Fox how he would react if approached by Romney's campaign team about the job, he said: \"I would say 'Let's talk'. It's not a slam-dunk.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=US+elections+2012&k=Mitt+Romney&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&k=United+States&k=US+politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mitt+Romney+enjoys+some+security+as+vice-presidential+contenders+shy+away+Article+1730154&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=US+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CMitt+Romney+%28News%29%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CUS+news%2CUS+politics&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-11&c8=1730154&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/11/mitt-romney-vice-presidential-prospects|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|6ec10db2821ba853392a3926ae71b2fec69275b9 -->",

          "headline": "Jack Tramiel obituary",
          "body": "<p>Jack Tramiel, who has died aged 83, will be remembered as the father of the Commodore 64, which dominated the home computer market of the 1980s. It shipped more than 20m units – an astonishing number at the time – and was often described as&nbsp;the bestselling computer of&nbsp;all time.</p><p>Unlike most of his competitors, Tramiel (pronounced Tra-mell) was not a technology geek. He was a jovial, cigar-smoking, balding and somewhat portly Jewish businessman known for hard bargaining and for the slogan: \"Business is war.\" He drove down costs, cut prices and marketed the hell out of whatever he was selling. He said he targeted \"the masses, not the&nbsp;classes\".</p><p>No one would have predicted Tramiel becoming, somewhat briefly, America's most successful computer tycoon. An&nbsp;only child, he was born, according to&nbsp;differing accounts, as Idek Tramielski or Jacek Trzmiel, in Lodz, Poland, which&nbsp;was occupied by the Nazis in&nbsp;1939. He was finally liberated from the Ahlem labour camp, near Hanover, by&nbsp;the US army in April 1945. His father did not survive.</p><p>The 18-year-old Tramiel married Helen Goldgrub, a Bergen-Belsen survivor, in 1947, then emigrated to&nbsp;the US. In 1948 he joined the&nbsp;US army, where he learned how to repair office equipment. On leaving in 1952, he used a&nbsp;$25,000 GI loan to set up a repair shop, Commodore Portable Typewriter, in the Bronx, New York. In 1955 he founded Commodore Business Machines, in Toronto, to import and sell typewriters, moving to California in&nbsp;1968.</p><p>Tramiel's lucky break came in the person of Chuck Peddle, lead designer at MOS Technology. Commodore had bought this small American chip manufacturer to supply parts for its pocket calculators. Peddle told him that computers were the future, and that MOS had developed the cheap 6502 microprocessor, which appeared later in the Apple II, Acorn BBC and other home computers. He let Peddle design the Commodore PET (personal electronic transactor) around the 6502, and in 1977 CBM entered the computer market.</p><p>The PET was followed by the limited but very cheap Vic-20, and in 1982 by the Commodore 64. This was marketed for its huge 64K of memory, though only 38K was free to the built-in Basic. The C64 used custom MOS Technology sound and graphics, so no rival was able to get anywhere near its $595 price. Tramiel duly started a price war, reducing it in stages to $199.</p><p>Commodore did $1bn worth of&nbsp;business in 1983, then Tramiel suddenly resigned after a dispute with the company chairman, the Canadian financier (and major shareholder) Irving Gould. He was not away for long. A few months later, he bought the ailing Atari consumer games business from Warner Brothers, and went head-to-head against Commodore in the old 8-bit and new 16-bit markets. However, he soon started to take a back seat, and his three sons took over the bulk of the work.</p><p>The main US computer companies were moving from the 6502 and its ilk to the 16/32-bit Motorola 68000 processor: Apple with the Macintosh, Commodore with the Amiga, and Tramiel's Atari with the 520ST, known as the Jackintosh. It delivered most of the capabilities of the Mac for a fraction of the price. However, IBM-compatible PCs were taking over the market, and Microsoft Windows dominated the 1990s. Commodore declared bankruptcy in 1994, with only Commodore UK surviving into 1995.</p><p>Atari tried to innovate with the Lynx colour handheld games console, the 64-bit Jaguar and the Atari Portfolio, the first PC-compatible palmtop. None took off. Tramiel sold up in 1996 and retired to Monte Sereno, California, with a&nbsp;palatial house and two Rolls-Royces.</p><p>Outside computing, Tramiel gave talks about the Holocaust at schools and universities, and he was a founding philanthropic supporter of the <a href=\"http://www.ushmm.org/\" title=\"\">United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</a> in&nbsp;Washington, DC. He never forgot.</p><p>Tramiel is survived by Helen, their three sons, Sam, Leonard and Garry, and&nbsp;five grandchildren.</p><p>• Jack Tramiel, businessman, born 13 December 1928; died 8 April 2012</p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBvbsPNBIyk\" title=\"\">Commodore 64 – 25th Anniversary Celebration</a></p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9C8xbbaRRA\" title=\"\">Jack Tramiel, Commodore Computers founder, interviewed</a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/technology&k=Computing&k=Technology&k=United+States&k=World+news\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/technology/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Jack+Tramiel+obituary+Article+1730107&ch=Technology&c2=148491&c4=Computing+%28Technology%29%2CTechnology%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Jack+Schofield&c7=12-Apr-11&c8=1730107&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: technology/2012/apr/11/jack-tramiel|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|13231b0d6606f271c55e5704f43df8d4e1f7b741 -->",

          "headline": "Prometheus preview footage: five things we learned",
          "body": "<p>It's T-50 until the release of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/145506/prometheus\" title=\"\">Prometheus</a> and on Tuesday the great and the good (OK, film hacks from around Europe) were invited to London's Leicester Square to watch a teensy bit more footage from the movie.</p><p>The crowd were shown approximately five minutes of new material, including what may be the entirety of the opening scene in which archaeologist Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and her lover and colleague Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) uncover a pictogram that Shaw sees as confirmation that aliens visited Earth in pre-history and invited humans back to theirs. Next we were whisked straight off into space and the exploratory vehicle Prometheus. We are introduced to the crew, from push-up loving suit Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron) to disgruntled staffer Fifield (Sean Harris). There's an on-ship briefing, a bit of truculent banter and the judicious use of technology which, it's fair to say, is far more sophisticated than that in the Nostromo, despite it taking to the skies decades later (in Alien time). From there the descent begins to planet LV223 and, one suspects, the trouble starts.</p><p>Back on Earth, we got the chance to pop a few questions in the direction of cast members Theron, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/michael-fassbender\" title=\"\">Michael Fassbender</a>  (who plays the ship's android, David) and Rapace. Oh, and Mother himself, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/ridley-scott\" title=\"\">Ridley Scott</a>. With the film so highly anticipated and its relation to the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/75860/alien\" title=\"\">Alien</a> series of movies <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2011/dec/23/prometheus-trailer-alien-ridley-scott\" title=\"\">still debated</a>, what did we learn from this little event?</p><p><strong>1)</strong> It's all about the \"space jockey\". The colloquial name for the creature uncovered by the crew of the Nostromo in the original Alien, the space jockey (James Cameron calls it \"the big dental patient\") is a carcass, its chest exploded in bits, probably by a xenomorph. In the Q+A, Scott said the \"who is the space jockey?\" question will be answered and that the film is \"the story of a pilot\".</p><p><strong>2)</strong> Elizabeth Shaw is the new Ripley. This may not surprise everyone – although it did one journalist, who asked Theron what it was like to follow in the footsteps of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/sigourney-weaver\" title=\"\">Sigourney Weaver</a> only to be told to redirect her question to Rapace instead. Shaw is the wide-eyed archaeologist who, in the UK trailer, discovers a crucial cave painting that leads to a trip into the stars. By the end of the movie, we're reliably informed, Shaw is transformed into a hardened, remorseless soldier. Whether that's a hardened, remorseless soldier with a weakness for ginger cats, remains to be seen.</p><p> <strong>3)</strong> Watch out for the Weyland Corporation. That's the company that funds Shaw's trip across the universe, and its CEO and founder is a nonagenarian called Peter (Guy Pearce in, it's fair to say, excessive prosthetics). Of course, anyone with even a passing association with the Alien movies will know that suits are not to be trusted. The footage showed a hologram of an apparently now deceased Weyland (that can happen during a transgalactic journey) publicly humiliating his charge, Vickers. This suggests they're still not to be touched with an electrified bargepole.</p><p><strong>4)</strong> There will be other Alien echoes. More than just a few, perhaps. While Scott says the links between Prometheus and the original film will only become clear \"in the final seven minutes\", it seems as though there will be a deliberate pairing of characters and events throughout. So for Shaw read Ripley, for Idris Elba's Janek read Tom Skerrit's Dallas (the scruffy but debonair captain) and there seems to be an expanded cast of disgruntled below-stairs workers too. Most intriguingly though, Scott hinted at there being an equivalent to the defining chestburst scene. When asked about the original, Scott said there will be a refiguring of some sorts in Prometheus; \"There will be an equivalent, but it will be private to Shaw,\" he said. The lucky girl.</p><p><strong>5)</strong> Fassbender might just steal the show. Everyone's favourite half-German plays David, the sole android on ship. Again, we know that in Alien Iain Holm's Ash sold the entire crew out. Will David do the same? That audience suspicion will seemingly be played on as, going by the footage, Fassbender plays David as an airy, affable butler figure, shuffling around the ship with the awkward grace of an arthritic ballet dancer. The character looks almost lovable, which would make for an even better doublecross. In London, Fassbender cited an intriguing mixture of influences for his role, ranging from the obvious, Blade Runner, to the unlikely, Dirk Bogarde's The Servant and Lawrence of Arabia, to the downright odd, in the shape of former Olympic diver Greg Louganis.</p><p>• This article was amended on Wednesday 11 April 2012. We originally said that Prometheus lands on planet LFE222, in fact the ship lands on LV223. This has been corrected. </p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/film&k=Science+fiction+and+fantasy&k=Film&k=Culture\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/film/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/film/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Prometheus+preview+footage%3A+five+things+we+learned+Article+1729659&ch=Film&c2=148491&c4=Science+fiction+and+fantasy+%28Film+genre%29%2CFilm%2CCulture&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Paul+MacInnes&c7=12-Apr-11&c8=1729659&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: film/filmblog/2012/apr/11/prometheus-preview-five-things-learned|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|fb37b8408b0a32707ad81ed6e81ab19eec998e6f -->",

The gang used specialist tools to lever out bricks and make a 3ft by 2ft hole to squeeze through, before seizing an 18th-century jade bowl and a <a href=\"http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_aboutchina/2003-09/24/content_21879.htm\" title=\"\">Dehua porcelain</a> sculpture, almost certainly to order. Overseas buyers with very deep pockets, including some in China where the artworks were originally created, have created a thriving market for such items.</p><p>The pieces were taken from the ground-floor Malcolm MacDonald gallery at 10.40pm last Thursday.</p><p>The university has been the victim of high-profile theft before, when its Shakespeare first folio was stolen in 1998 and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2010/jul/09/raymond-scott-stolen-shakespeare-first-folio\" title=\"\">later criminally obtained by local antiques dealer and eccentric Raymond Scott</a>.</p><p>The book was recovered, slightly damaged, and Scott was jailed. He was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2012/mar/14/shakespeare-folio-dealer-dead-scott\" title=\"\">found dead in prison</a> earlier this year.</p><p>Police have arrested five people from the West Midlands for questioning about the theft of the Chinese pieces but have not yet recovered either of the stolen artefacts. Both date from the 18th-century period of the Qing dynasty, China's last ruling family.</p><p>The large green bowl carved with writhing dragons dates from 1769 and has a Chinese poem written inside, while the sculpture is of seven fairies in a boat, beautifully crafted in translucent porcelain with a creamy glaze and standing about 30cm (12in) high. The bowl was obtained in China by Sir Charles Hardinge, a diplomat in the early 20th century who was noted for his early admiration for Gandhi. Hardinge also collected pottery and precious stones.</p><p>Detective Superintendent Adrian Green of Durham police <a href=\"http://www.durham.police.uk/press/news.php?id=2178&amp;area=1&amp;station=3\" title=\"\">said</a>: \"It seems very clear that this was a well planned, highly organised break-in. They have spent around 40 minutes creating a hole in an outside wall and, when it has been big enough, they have entered the gallery and made straight for these two items.</p><p>\"I am sure this job has been planned for quite some time and I would think the artefacts have been stolen to order, for someone who has already identified a potential market.\"</p><p>One of the people arrested, a 27-year-old man from Walsall, was questioned at a police station in County Durham on suspicion of assisting an offender, and has been released on police bail until June. The other four, a 34-year-old woman and three men aged 56, 41 and 36, were released on bail until June after being questioned in Durham on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary.</p><p>The museum's curator, Dr Craig Barclay, said after the theft: \"We are extremely upset to have fallen victim to such a serious crime. The two pieces are highly significant in that they are fine examples of artefacts from the Qing dynasty in the mediums of porcelain and hard stone.</p><p>\"We very much hope that police will be able to recover them and we urge anybody who may have any information about their whereabouts to contact the police immediately.\"</p><p>The museum was closed over Easter, usually a busy period, because of the theft.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/uk&k=Crime&k=Museums&k=Durham+University&k=Higher+education&k=Education&k=Culture\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/uk/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Specialist+criminals+stole+%C2%A32m+Chinese+artefacts+from+university%2C+say+police+Article+1729666&ch=UK+news&c2=148491&c4=Crime+-+UK+%28News%29%2CMuseums+%28Culture%29%2CDurham+University%2CHigher+education+%28Universities+etc.%29%2CEducation%2CCulture%2CUK+news%2CSculpture+%28Art+and+design%29%2CArt+and+design&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Martin+Wainwright&c7=12-Apr-11&c8=1729666&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: uk/2012/apr/11/2m-chinese-artefacts-durham-university|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|f9baa335b0a51d02d4b33b1082b5ea75651e5378 -->",

You can use the free version of the app to flash ClockworkMod Recovery on your device, reboot into recovery, install ROMs, or manage backups.</p></blockquote><p> This was flagged to us on Twitter as indicating that Cyanogenmod will \"soon be mainstream\". Our response: 99.9x% of Android users will never, ever mod their phones. They wouldn't even understand that extract.</p><h2><a href=\"http://blogs.smartmoney.com/advice/2012/04/10/with-instagram-facebook-gets-holy-grail-of-data/\">With Instagram, Facebook gets 'holy grail' of data - real-time advice &gt;&gt; SmartMoney</a></h2><blockquote><p>Snap a digital photo, and the file typically includes embedded information on where and when it was taken. Facebook says Instagram will remain a standalone app separate from the social networking site, but the acquisition could make it easier for marketers, advertisers and the apps and companies one \"likes\" to access that kind of photo information, says Deborah Mitchell, executive director for the Center of Brand and Product Management at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p></blockquote><p> Could be worth anywhere from $50 to $5,000 per user, apparently, because it says where you are (if you turn on location capture) and what you're interested in. Value-enhancing for Facebook if so.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/88bbbe56-7e8b-11e1-b7e7-00144feab49a.html#axzz1rcNWbNE4\">Investors demand change at ailing UK tech companies &gt;&gt; FT.com</a></h2><p>Intriguing - and unusual - viewpoint on small UK tech businesses. </p><blockquote><p>Jon Moulton, the private equity investor who bought Clarity at the end of last year, says that every few years the largest of the small-cap technology investors become restless and start to shop around their portfolios to private equity.</p><p> Private equity firms are in turn often keen to snap up these struggling businesses in the hope of being able to turn them around with radical management changes.</p><p> \"A lot of UK technology companies are really stable, cash-generating businesses and are only in a loss because of poor managers,\" says Mr Moulton.</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://securosis.com/blog/the-myth-of-the-security-smug-mac-user\">The myth of the security-smug Mac user &gt;&gt; Securosis Blog</a></h2><p>Rich Mogull: </p><blockquote><p>This is anecdotal, and I don't have survey numbers to back it up, but I've been probably the most prominent writer on Mac security for the past 5 years, and talk to a ton of people in person and over email. Nearly universally Mac users are and have been, concerned about security and malware.</p><p> So where does this myth come from? I think it's 3 sources.</p></blockquote><p> Read the three sources before you comment.</p><h2><a href=\"http://allthingsd.com/20120410/bye-bye-thrive-tablets-hello-toshiba-excite/\">Bye-bye, Thrive tablets; hello, Toshiba Excite &gt;&gt; AllThingsD</a></h2><p>Remember the crazy sales of the Toshiba Thrive tablet? Anyway. </p><blockquote><p>Toshiba's new Excite line, which the Japanese electronics maker is officially announcing today, will include 7.7-inch, 10-inch and 13-inch models. All three Wi-Fi-only tablets are running Google's Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich operating system; they are aluminum-encased, have Gorilla Glass displays, come with a five-megapixel rear camera and a two-megapixel front-facing camera, and include new Nvidia TegraTM 3 processors.</p><p> The Excite 7.7 also has an AMOLED display, a micro-USB port and a micro-SD card slot; while the Excite 10 has an LED-backlit display, micro-USB and micro-HDMI ports, and a full-sized SD card slot. At 1.32 pounds, the new 10-inch weighs just slightly less than Toshiba's last tablet.</p></blockquote><p> Great specifications. Gartner's prediction: iPads (no AMOLED, no built-in micro-SD or HDMI ports) will outsell Android tablets 2:1 in 2012.</p><h2><a href=\"http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2012/04/09/poll-people-like-google-more-than-apple-or-facebook-with-chart-and-full-results\">Poll: People like Google more than Apple or Facebook [with chart and full results] &gt;&gt; DWMedia</a></h2><p>Appears to be a statistically rigorous poll: </p><blockquote><p>In addition to very broad popularity, Google and Apple share vast exposure. Just 10% of Americans haven't formed a basic opinion of Google (rising to 29% of less tech-savvy seniors), and 14% have no opinion of Apple and Facebook alike. Twitter is less well known, with 31% unready to express an opinion of it, jumping to 51% of seniors.</p></blockquote><p> Basically, old geezers don't approve of tech.

          "body": "<p>Barack Obama embarked on a full day of election campaigning in Florida, a key swing state, hammering Mitt Romney and the Republicans over their support for tax breaks for millionaires.</p><p>The Obama re-election campaign had treated Romney as the likely nominee for months, apart from an occasional wobble as Rick Santorum scored surprise wins. But with Santorum out of the race Tuesday, Obama knows with certainty who his opponent will be in February.</p><p>Obama targeted Romney in a speech at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton in which he highlighted the so-called \"Buffett rule\": that millionaires and billionaires should not be paying lower tax rates than working-class Americans. The rule is named for billionaire investor Warren Buffett.</p><p>Although Romney has wealth estimated at around $200m, he paid a tax rate of only 13.9% in 2010, less than many working-class Americans.</p><p>Congress is scheduled to vote on the \"Buffett rule\" on Monday, but it is opposed by Republicans and has no chance of passing. The proposed legislation would mean that millionaires would pay at least the same percentage in taxes as working-class families.</p><p>\"It's time for us to choose which direction we want to go in as a country,\" Obama said, rehearsing what is shaping up as a major general election theme. \"Do we want to keep giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans like me, or Warren Buffett or Bill Gates – people who don't need them and never asked for them? Or do we want to keep investing in things that will grow our economy and keep us secure?

          "body": "<p>Newt Gingrich has cheekily called on Rick Santorum's supporters to throw their weight behind him to prevent Mitt Romney becoming the Republican presidential nominee.</p><p>Gingrich repeatedly split the rightwing vote with Santorum, allowing Romney to win state after state that he might otherwise have lost if faced with only one of them.</p><p>Santorum, who won 11 states to only two taken by Gingrich, expressed frustration that there was no single candidate for conservatives to unite behind, and repeatedly urged Gingrich to stand aside.</p><p>But it is too late for either of them. Even with Santorum out of the race, Gingrich's campaign collapsed last month when, portraying himself as a southern candidate, he failed to win either Mississippi or Alabama.</p><p>He has since only been going through the motions, with donations having dried up.  </p><p>In a statement Tuesday, he praised Santorum for having fought a spirited campaign. He added: \"I am committed to staying in this race all the way to Tampa so that the conservative movement has a real choice.</p><p>\"I humbly ask Senator Santorum's supporters to visit newt.org to review my conservative record and join us as we bring these values to Tampa. We know well that only a conservative can protect life, defend the constitution, restore jobs and growth and return to a balanced budget.\"</p><p>In an interview with Fox on Sunday, Gingrich described Romney as \"far and away the most likely Republican nominee\".  </p><p>When he ceased campaigning in any meaningful sense, Gingrich said he hoped that there might still be a showdown if Romney fell short of the 1,144 majority of delegates needed in Tampa. But he admitted on Sunday that if that failed to happen, he would fall in behind Romney in the campaign against Obama.</p><p>Last month Gingrich was much more bullish about his prospects and dismissive of Romney's status as frontrunner. He predicted that Romney would fail to secure the 1,144 delegates, that the decision would be brokered at the convention and that Romney was not much of a frontrunner, having done poorly in the Mississippi and Louisiana primaries.</p><p>Jay Bookman, a columnist on the Atlanta Constitution-Journal, <a href=\"http://blogs.ajc.com/jay-bookman-blog/2012/03/29/the-gingrich-political-career-now-at-an-end/\">wrote recently</a>: \"He [Gingrich] has no money and in fact his campaign is deeply in debt. He lacks the resources to travel, let alone buy campaign ads, and the press has abandoned him, raising the age-old question: if a man utters pearls of profound wisdom, and no-one is there to hear him, did he really utter them at all? Yet still he presses on, insistent against all evidence that he remains relevant.\" </p><p>Fox News labels Gingrich's bid as \"the zombie campaign\". The question now, is whether the zombie will finally lay down and die.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Newt+Gingrich&k=Mitt+Romney&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&k=Republicans&k=US+elections+2012&k=US+politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Newt+Gingrich+to+Rick+Santorum+supporters%3A+vote+for+me+Article+1729566&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Newt+Gingrich%2CMitt+Romney+%28News%29%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CRepublicans+%28US%29%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CUS+politics%2CUS+national+security%2CWorld+news%2CUS+news&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729566&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/10/newt-gingrich-rick-santorum-vote-for-me|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|4d8f472221e3de6d7c51027dc83789d2f6ef19ac -->",

          "body": "<p><em>SPOILER ALERT: This blog is for those who are watching season five of Mad Men on Sky Atlantic. Don't read on if you haven't seen episode four</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/apr/03/mad-men-season-five-episode-three\" title=\"\">Paul MacInnes's episode three blog</a></p><h2>Mystery Date<br /></h2><p>A busy week, but let's start with Sally Draper and <a href=\"http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/grandma-pauline\" title=\"\">Grandma Pauline</a>. It wasn't the central narrative in this episode, and it certainly wasn't the most dramatic (I guess throttling an ex-lover to death claims that prize), but it was a most interesting coming together of characters driven by some wonderful acting, especially on the part of 11-year-old Kiernan Shipka.</p><p>The setup has been prefigured. Grandma Pauline has been looming in the shadows of the haunted mansion since last season; strict, sceptical and, let's face it, no oil painting, she is Betty's nemesis. This week however, Betty is in Buffalo. Sally is left at home and Granny is in charge. The encounter starts off combative and ends up trusting, but the way in which it develops sheds further light on how Sally is no mummy's girl.</p><p>We first see Sally in this episode complaining to her father about Pauline's overbearing behaviour. She does so assertively and with the odd snide aside \"[She] wears so much perfume\". So far so Betty. Next Sally is confronted by Pauline in ogre mode, slapping her hands for attempting to read the newspaper and snapping 'Some things are not for children\". The next assault occurs as Sally's view of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHsQpTbQ9Uo\" title=\"\">Mystery Date</a> (will someone spare the young from premature sexualisation!) is disturbed by Pauline's not so discreet discussion of the Chicago nurse murders. Conversation eventually turns to what we know is underlying all this tension, Pauline's disdain for Betty's parenting. She tells Sally that she would benefit from having some discipline in her life. Sally bridles. Pauline goes further, recalling a piece of casual paternal violence:</p><p>Pauline: He woke up and said; \"that's for nothing, so look out.\"</p><p>Sally: \"That's not very nice.\"</p><p>Pauline: \"No, but it was valuable advice.\"</p><p>The look on Sally's face as she hears this is the highlight of the hour. It's shock and fear, obviously, but it's also intrigue – in what kind of world might such a thing happen? – and then a final flash of what looks like calculation, as if the girl is working out whether such advice might actually be useful.</p><p>Now there's the characteristic whiff of feminine Mad Men self-loathing in that exchange, but still. By the end of the hour Pauline has formed a bond with Sally so great that they can get doped up on sleeping tablets. Along the way Pauline reveals herself to be a forthright woman of the world, and Sally someone willing to pay attention. Pauline, it turns out, makes demands of Sally, but she also treats her with respect. Sally responds positively to this. It will be interesting to see where the two go from here.</p><h2>Goodbye to Greg</h2><p>He came, he looked ripped, he left forever. The collapse of Joan's tangled marriage with Greg Harris was quick and, as was to be expected, unpleasant. As with his original enlisting, Greg did not consult Joan over his decision to stay in Vietnam for another year. The approbation of his peers (20 men look up to him, at last) mattered more than that of his wife. Joan's shock was as real as her determination to be the good wife during his shore leave, but you can't help but think; good riddance to bad, bad rubbish. What's more, the whole paternity thing now gets a degree less thorny.</p><h2>The Joy of Ginzo</h2><p>Michael Ginsberg, mouthy genius. That appears to be the size of things after the new hire wowed a prospective shoe, sorry, footwear client with a double pitch that drilled straight into the female id. Or so all the men in the room thought anyway.</p><p>In his second pitch, the \"too dark\" one, we see Draper-esque psychological conjuring, the difference being that Mike apparently \"gets\" women. Cinderella is being pursued down a dark alley, but yet \"she wants to be caught\". Her pursuer is not attractive but still seductive (perhaps a bit like our Mike?). It's his pursuit that has a power over Cinderella, that and the fact he's found her missing slipper.</p><p>The pitch is snapped up right away, a bollocking from Don follows shortly afterwards. The pretext is insubordination, taking the meeting in an unexpected direction. The subtext is obsolescence, Don raging at the younger colleague with the fresh new ideas. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/24/mad-men-matthew-weiner\" title=\"\">Matthew Weiner</a> has talked about this broader idea, the fear of becoming outmoded, and Don's reaction seems to play into that. For my money, I think the relationship between the two will prove to be more subtle than a straight-up oedipal conflict. Hey, they just might learn something from each other.</p><h2>Don's dream</h2><p>Sorry, but I didn't dig on this. Don is consigned to bed with a fever and a cough that, if this were a TV movie, would turn out to be the early stages of lung cancer. Instead it's a device with which the show can explore Don's commitment or otherwise to his new life of monogamy. That and chuck a bit of raunch in.</p><p>Probing Don's sexual morals is an entirely legitimate area for exploration and, one might say, central to Mad Men as a whole. To do it in his sleep, however, just seems like a cop out. Is it entirely impossible for an encounter with an assertive ex-lover to have happened during waking hours? It would have required a more nuanced resolution than either denial or death by strangulation, but I think that would have been more in keeping with the show. As it was, however, I felt we learned nothing but got fed some eye candy and eye-bulging violence as a substitute.</p><h2>This week's other notes</h2><p>Top bantz between Roger and Peggy. Is Roger now officially being played for laughs?</p><p>I like Stan Rizzo. Even when he's wearing pantyhose like some kind of mugger.</p><p>I also like Joyce Ramsay. Her nicknames are great (Paggasus!). This week it was her turn to wear the bad check jacket.</p><h2>Time stamps</h2><p>Another disappointing element to the hour was the way in which background events were shoved so heavily to the foreground. Particularly the repeated exposition regarding the killing of eight student nurses from South Chicago Community Hospital by one <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Speck\" title=\"\">Richard Speck</a>. The murders caused panic and wild speculation (about Speck's genetic make up among other things) but are now largely forgotten. Which may explain the exposition, but didn't stop it from feeling a bit heavy.</p><p>\"I think this will get on the cover rather than the riots\", says Joyce Ramsay while doling out Speck photos to the SCDP youngsters (interestingly, Megan included). She goes on to say that \"there's been five riots already this summer\" and we learn from Dawn that there are more, localised incidents which might not get reported, never mind appear on the cover of Time. The summer of 1966 does not match the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_Riots\" title=\"\">Watts riots</a> of the previous summer or the summer of 1968 in intensity, but it shows that this strain of civil disturbance was neither going away nor being heeded by the white ruling class.</p><p>These two incidents are, of course, brought together smartly for just one brief moment as Peggy confuses Dawn's very real fear of being attacked in her neighbourhood with the panic over Speck. That Peggy then follows it up by accusing her (with a solitary gaze at a handbag) of being a potential thief makes matters worse.</p><p>\"From July 8 to August 19, 1966 over 35,000 airline workers across the nation employed by five airlines went on strike.\" – I've pasted that straight from Wikipedia because this plot point was so dull that only Pete Campbell could get interested in it.</p><h2>Culture club</h2><p>\"I was discovered. Like Esther Blodgett\" – Peggy compares herself to Judy Garland in A Star is Born. Which must make the dipsomaniac James Mason character...</p><p>Mystery Date. I'm sure Sally's rapture at the TV ad might have had elements of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/oct/06/mad-men-season-four-episode-five\">Illya Kuryakin</a> about it, but she might also have wanted to get her hands on the <a href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7314/mystery-date\">Milton Bradley board game</a> where \"Depending on how the doorknob is rotated, a different guy will 'appear'.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio&k=Mad+Men&k=Television&k=Drama&k=Historical+drama&k=US+television&k=Television+%26+radio\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mad+Men%3A+season+five%2C+episode+four+Article+1729485&ch=Television+%26amp%3B+radio&c2=148491&c4=Mad+Men+%28TV%29%2CTelevision+%28Culture%29%2CDrama+%28TV+genre%29%2CHistorical+drama+%28TV+genre%29%2CUS+television+%28TV+and+radio%29%2CTelevision+and+radio+TV%2CCulture&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Paul+MacInnes&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729485&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2012/apr/10/mad-men-season-five-episode-four|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|1baca2d861122b4b51c9095aa7762045e741928b -->",

          "headline": "Rick Santorum bows to the inevitable and quits Republican presidential race",
          "body": "<p>Mitt Romney looks certain to be the Republican candidate facing Barack Obama in the fight for the White House in November after his last serious rival, Rick Santorum, bowed to the inevitable and quit the race for their party's nomination. </p><p>After a bruising campaign that began in Iowa on January 3, Santorum declared at a press conference in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania: \"The race is over for me.\" The decision leaves Romney with a clear route to the Republican nomination at the party convention in August.</p><p>Flanked by his family and close aides, Santorum said: \"We made the decision to get into this race at our kitchen table against all the odds, and we made a decision over the weekend that while this presidential race is over for me – and we will suspend our campaign effective today – we're not done fighting,\" adding he would continue to battle have his socially conservative views heard.</p><p>Romney, freed from the distraction of having to campaign in the Republican race, will now be able to focus his energy and funds on the battle with Obama. He must now hope that the deep GOP divisions exposed in the primaries and caucuses can be bridged, and that the Republican party will unite behind him.</p><p>The former Massachusetts governor can depend on the party millionaires who regard Obama as too left-wing to pile in behind him, ready to fund one of the biggest negative ad campaigns in US political history. The question is whether the party grassroots – who regard Romney as too moderate – will join the rally behind him.</p><p>Romney has much ground to make up. Obama's re-election campaign team, based in Chicago, has been building networks of supporters in the swing states, and Obama himself has been out on the campaign trail for months. As Santorum was delivering his resignation speech, Obama was taking to the stage at an event in Florida.</p><p>The president, in a speech at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, hammered the Republicans over their protection of tax breaks for millionaires, which Obama intends to make a key election issue – one he hopes will define the difference between Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>\"It's time for us to choose which direction we want to go in as a country,\" Obama said. \"Do we want to keep giving tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans like me, or Warren Buffett, or Bill Gates – people who don't need them and never asked for them?  Or do we want to keep investing in things that will grow our economy and keep us secure?  That's the choice.\"</p><p>He did not mention Romney or his wealth directly, but the implication was clear.</p><p>Obama held fundraising events on either side of the speech, bringing in an estimated $1.9m.</p><p>Polls show Obama with significant leads over Romney, particularly among women. The outcome could be determined by whether the economy continues to recover over the summer and autumn.</p><p>Santorum, in his Gettysburg remarks, did not offer support or endorsement of Romney by name. </p><p>In a statement minutes after Santorum finished his speech, Romney was gracious: \"Senator Santorum is an able and worthy competitor, and I congratulate him on the campaign he ran. He has proven himself to be an important voice in our party and in the nation.\"</p><p>Romney consistently outspent Santorum and other rivals in advertising, by margins of four-to-one or higher. Romney's campaign, and the nominally independent political action committee that supports it, are estimated to have spent more than $30m.   </p><p>Official figures for March are due out later this week but Time magazine, based on returns submitted to the end of February, estimated that the Romney campaign spent $17.14 per voter compared with $2.54 for Santorum.</p><p>Santorum has been a stubborn opponent, winning a string of states, including Iowa, with his under-funded campaign contrasting with Romney's millions.  </p><p>He won 11 states, including victories in Colorado and Minnesota in February and Alabama and Mississippi in March. His departure brings to an end a race that produced lots of ups and downs, with Republicans replacing one another as party favourite with on a frequent basis dating back to the Ames straw poll in Iowa in August.   </p><p>Congresswoman Michele Bachmann gave way as party favourite to Texas governor Rick Perry, who in turn was replaced by pizza mogul Herman Cain and then former House speaker Newt Gingrich. \"This race was as improbable as any race you will see for president,\" Santorum told reporters in Gettysburg. He was the most socially conservative of the candidates, his anti-gay and anti-abortion views winning a core of supporters among Christian evangelicals.</p><p>Santorum said he was suspending his campaign rather than quitting, a technicality that allows him to continue fundraising to clear his campaign debts.   </p><p>Gingrich is still theoretically in the Republican race, but has all but given up campaigning, and admitted weeks ago that Romney would win. The outsider, Congressman Ron Paul, said he will remain in the race, fighting his own idiosyncratic campaign but is so far behind he stands no chance of catching Romney.</p><p>Paul congraluted Santorum on a \"spirited campaign\" and insisted he planned to press the fight all the way to the party convention in Florida in August.</p><p>Santorum cited as one of his reasons for leaving the race his daughter Bella, who is seriously ill and who spent the weekend in hospital before being discharged on Monday.   </p><p>But his exit was also an acknowledgement of the brutal arithmetic. When he failed to win the Illinios primary last month, Romney's lead became insurmountable. Santorum refused at the time to quit, hoping to win Pennsylvania in a fortnight, but polls showed his initial advantage disappearing, and it would have been a major embarrassment for him to have lost his home state.</p><p>There will be speculation that Romney might pick him as his vice-presidential running mate, or even as a member of his cabinet, though that would be awkward given the comments Santorum has made about him, including the charge that Romney has no core principles.</p><p>Santorum may instead treat the 2012 race as a practice run for 2016, though he would need to widen his appeal beyond socially conservative Republicans.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Rick+Santorum&k=Republican+presidential+nomination+2012&k=Republicans&k=US+elections+2012&k=United+States&k=US+politics\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Rick+Santorum+bows+to+the+inevitable+and+quits+Republican+presidential+race+Article+1729552&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Rick+Santorum%2CRepublican+presidential+nomination+2012%2CRepublicans+%28US%29%2CUS+elections+2012+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CUS+politics%2CWorld+news%2CBarack+Obama+%28News%29%2CMitt+Romney+%28News%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Ewen+MacAskill+in+Washington&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729552&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/10/rick-santorum-quits-republican-race|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|04faadabdacffc059bdd1c5104f04b131f159a6b -->",

          "headline": "Mental health treatment gets street smart",
          "body": "<p>Four years ago, Charlie Alcock was spat on, ignored, had pebbles thrown at her and was suspected of being an undercover police officer by the north London gang she was trying to strike up a conversation with by hanging around their fish and chip shop of choice.</p><p>The incongruity of a privately educated, academically high-achieving, white woman raised in rural Gloucestershire appearing from nowhere and saying she wanted their help was clearly not lost on the group of two dozen or so urban young men, who had  struggled to stay in school and spent most of their days smoking cannabis and getting into trouble. It took six months before one member of the group even asked her, \"in a not very polite way\", what she was doing there.</p><p>Alcock, an NHS psychologist who wanted to start up a social enterprise tackling the causes of youth crime, gave him the short version: that although there were services aimed at his group, they weren't working. \"And I think you know what works,\" she told him.</p><p>Over the next few months, the teenager became a go-between, conveying ideas between Alcock and his peers about what sort of a project they wanted to set up, eventually settling on music.</p><p>The music group was the genesis of <a href=\"http://www.musicandchange.com/\" title=\"\">Mac-UK</a>, the charity Alcock subsequently founded in 2008 in collaboration with the young people involved in gangs. It was a way to engage with them and build relationships in order to start working with them on mental health issues.</p><p>Alcock wanted to find new ways to address the link between mental health and youth offending. \"The group that was of great interest to me was young offenders, and the fact that one in three young people who offend have an unmet mental health need at the time of offence,\" she says.</p><p>Treatment or, as Alcock terms it, \"street therapy\" needed to be administered wherever young people would feel comfortable – whether in fish and chip shops or on park benches. It is a long haul. Alcock admits that \"even now there are young people we've known for three years and they are only just beginning to work with us\".</p><p>The Mac-UK programme works intensively for as long as two years with about 30 young \"severely deprived\" people aged between 16 and 25, often homeless. All have refused traditional offers of help. Street therapy is central to the project, with young people self-referring and deciding when, where and for how long they would like to meet.</p><p>Her insight into how she might better reach young offenders came while working on an \"alternative to incarceration\" project in New York during her clinical training. There, one young man told her that as a result of talking to psychologists like her, his cousin had been killed for \"snitching\".</p><p>\"Until you can find a way to work with us that's safe, you might as well go home because you're actually putting us at more risk than if you weren't here,\" she recalls him saying.</p><p>For people on the margins of society there's a distrust of public services – either because of a bad experience with the authorities or from fear of imprisonment, says Alcock. The only way to reach them was to become part of the furniture of their lives.</p><p>Alcock views gangs as enterprises whose goals needs fixing rather than as ventures that need to be disbanded. Gangs might be criminal in outlook but, she argues, they can be transformed into community organisations, responding to people's needs.</p><p>\"It's about what the group does. So the whole idea of Mac is that gradually the peer group begins to do something more pro-social, collectively. Rather than dealing drugs, carrying weapons, they're setting up a music project or whatever it might be,\" she says. The young people use their DJ skills to run the music sessions themselves, employed by Mac-UK.</p><p>From dealing with troubled teenagers Alcock can see that on the street there is an explosive mix of heavy skunk [cannabis] use, frightening levels of domestic violence growing up and clinical depression. Some youngsters speak of hearing voices, others admit self-harm.</p><p>\"This group have often grown up with lack of adult role models, found school particularly challenging, and you mix some of those risk factors with environments of real threat – which is what gangs create, and you add skunk as self-treatment, then it's no wonder that a lot of these young people do have issues with mental health,\" she explains.</p><p>To engage such disaffected and chaotic young people, the 16-strong Mac-UK team, which includes psychologists, youth workers and volunteers, seeks to win their trust by taking part in whatever group activity is taking place. \"So [if] there's a gym group, we have mental health workers on the treadmill – going quite slow,\" says Alcock.</p><p>Once a bond has been established, Mac-UK sessions with trained staff can occur anywhere. These \"might take place on buses, benches, stairwells. We might go with a young person to court – waiting for four hours to be seen by the judge is an amazing opportunity to do work,\" she says. \"The young people definitely trust me now [and] others in the team,\" she adds.</p><p>As well as providing mental health support to those who need it and improving their access to mainstream services, Mac-UK aims to reduce re-offending and get the young people into employment, education or training. Three-quarters of the first cohort moved into training, education or employment – albeit temporarily for some. Three of the young men on the music scheme have gone on to set up their own successful project – Mini Mac – which delivers music and mental health awareness into schools.</p><p>It is a persuasive pitch from an assertive 32-year-old social entrepreneur, bidding to solve some of society's most intractable problems. As Alcock says: \"Five per cent of young people cause 95% of youth crimes, and it's that 5% that we work with.\"</p><p>Her approach, which has been funded by the <a href=\"http://www.phf.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Paul Hamlyn Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://www.camden.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Camden council</a>, is now being evaluated by the <a href=\"http://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Mental Health Foundation</a>. It is also being piloted in another area of north London with a plan to set up a further three projects in the capital in the next 18 months. The projects will be in partnership with staff from council and NHS services, who Mac-UK will take under its wing and introduce to the young people.</p><p>\"They're often young people who are homeless or have moved out of their family situation, so they're often in young persons' hostels or sleeping on friends' sofas, occasionally rough sleeping. In our experience, if one of this group was homeless it's going to be the local drug dealer that gives them a room. That is how it works,\" says&nbsp;Alcock.</p><p>Her Mac-UK model can be adapted at a local level, she says, because it is \"grown from the ground up\" by the young people that it seeks to help. She adds: \"I want it to become the status quo for working with this demographic.\"</p><h2><strong>Curriculum vitae</strong></h2><p><strong>Age</strong> 32.</p><p><strong>Lives</strong> North-west London.</p><p><strong>Family</strong> Engaged.</p><p><strong>Education</strong> Cheltenham ladies college; Warwick University, sociology degree; Oxford Brookes University, psychology conversion; Salomons campus – Canterbury Christ Church University, PhD in clinical psychology, specialising in community psychology.</p><p><strong>Career</strong> 2008-present: chief executive, Mac-UK; 2007-08: clinical psychologist, Camden and Islington NHS foundation trust, assertive outreach team for adults with severe and enduring mental health issues.</p><p><strong>Public life</strong> Member of the independent advisory network for the Home Office's ending gang violence team.</p><p><strong>Interests</strong> Snow-boarding and crafts, including making cards, candles and bath bombs.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/society&k=Mental+health&k=Gangs&k=Communities&k=Young+people&k=Health&k=Society\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/society/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/society/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Mental+health+treatment+gets+street+smart+Article+1728950&ch=Society&c2=148491&c4=Mental+health+%28Society%29%2CGangs+%28Society%29%2CCommunities+%28Society%29%2CYoung+people+%28Society%29%2CHealth+%28Society%29%2CSociety&c3=The+Guardian&c6=Raekha+Prasad&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1728950&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: society/2012/apr/10/mental-health-street-smart-charlie-alcock|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|bce3011e2235a5e69c7929af9df0c0af9bdcacd7 -->",

          "headline": "It's time for a register of interests for science academics",
          "body": "<p>A professor friend of mine was telling me recently how popular he was with his vice-chancellor. Not, he stressed, because of his respectable smattering of reasonably original papers in journals with quite short titles. Nor for his teaching, since he hardly did any. No. It was the money he raised.</p><p>This is a top table topic at present in academia, as Guardian science contributors have noted. \"Can basic research be saved from the tyranny of the profit motive?\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/feb/23/scientists-basic-research-business\" title=\"\">asked, for example, Nature's Ananyo Bhattacharya in February</a>, lamenting the perennial cash crisis of blue skies.</p><p>But don't ask me how much my pal raised, or the paws from which he prised it. Although I know it was the usual tens and hundreds of grand from a balanced portfolio of industry, government and charity sources, common courtesy discouraged further inquiry. In truth, I don't care. But somebody might. In which case, tough luck on them.</p><p>Although triumphant in the common room over their front-of-the-plane funding, successful science academics (particularly in biosciences) are often as publicly transparent about the paymasters behind their publishing as chefs are about rats behind the fridge.</p><p>This isn't news. The evidence is overwhelming. You could build yourself a treehouse of printed worries. And even Francis Collins, director of the US National Institutes of Health, has called for compulsory online registers of researchers' interests as a condition of federal funding. \"The public may not always understand the intricacies of rigorous science,\" <a href=\"http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/303/23/2400\" title=\"\">he wrote two years ago</a>, \"but most individuals quickly grasp the concept of bias.\"</p><p>What came of his proposal? <a href=\"http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2011/08/new-us-conflict-of-interest-rule.html\" title=\"\">Pretty much zilch</a>. So, was there a storm in science media? Of course not. Though weeping like clockwork crocodiles over the murky side of mullah, science editors couldn't give a monkey's backside. Why would they? Why would, say, Nature fret over who picks up its authors' tabs, so long as it isn't its behemoth publisher, <a href=\"http://www.macmillan.com/\" title=\"\">MacMillan</a>?</p><p>As long as scientists get more money (which I think was Bhattacharya's point) and the idea doesn't get round that most science articles are advertising, the tobacco industry's dosh is the same colour as Marie Curie's. All it needs is a good scrub for opacity. More worrying to journal editors would be any dent in reader loyalty triggered by stirring public pressures to disclose.</p><p>I have a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2563288/?tool=pubmed\" title=\"\">favourite paper</a> from seven years ago which opened a tiny window on all this. <a href=\"http://grovevetshighpeak.com/the-team\" title=\"\">Sue Mayer</a>, now an English Peak District vet, checked six months' worth of Nature reports on genetics and molecular biology against authors' patent interests filed elsewhere. It wasn't life's biggest study. She didn't find the Higgs Boson. But what she did find should make you wince.</p><p>Working with the <a href=\"http://www.genewatch.org/\" title=\"\">GeneWatch</a> group, she calculated that an astonishing two thirds of authors with a related patent claim hadn't felt moved to declare this in their papers. \"The research reported here,\" she concluded in the <a href=\"http://jme.bmj.com/\" title=\"\">Journal of Medical Ethics</a>, \"indicates that failure to report competing financial interests in original research published in Nature is the norm, not the exception.\"</p><p>And what was the reaction to this dazzling snapshot? She tells me: \"They took not the slightest bit of notice.\"</p><p>Which brings me back to my pal the professor, or more particularly to his delighted vice-chancellor. With nobody but a public, perhaps to be swindled or maimed, with much stake in who's paying whom, I fear our best chance of disinfecting science with light must lie in academia itself.</p><p>Although the White House last year dumped on Collins's plan, the self-evident innovation would be for the institutions themselves to introduce compulsory registers. Some units already have them, in a haphazard kind of way, but every university should have a publicly searchable database of academics' external sources of money.</p><p>Competing commercial interests would then be readily checkable, saving labours such as Mayer's. This is obvious. And every kind of funder, from children's charities to GlaxoSmithKline, could be back-tracked for influence, year-on-year.</p><p>The gristle in the pasty, of course, is that academics run academia. And they're not exactly jostling to log their interests. That would be a step closer to league tables and sub-specialty beauty contests – in which those with enough stats might dread falling below the median, risking inquiries that manners surely forbid.</p><p>Academics also manage, however, and there's big bucks to be had there (and, for British men, that wondrous title \"Professor Sir\"). But for those males who wish to excel (while making their wives a Lady), my friend reckons the opportunity to use a register to fire people may be no less enticing than the dough.</p><p></p><p><em>Brian Deer's website is </em><a href=\"http://briandeer.com/\" title=\"\"><em>briandeer.com</em></a></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/science&k=Science&k=Science&k=Education&k=Higher+education&k=Biosciences\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/science/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/science/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=It%27s+time+for+a+register+of+interests+for+science+academics+%7C+Brian+Deer+Article+1729265&ch=Science&c2=148491&c4=Science%2CScience+%28Education+subject%29%2CEducation%2CHigher+education+%28Universities+etc.%29%2CBiosciences+%28Education+subject%29&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Brian+Deer&c7=12-Apr-10&c8=1729265&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: science/2012/apr/10/register-of-interests-science-academics|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|9b5531ec35799c8b1280dee28a0c93a7bf589923 -->",

          "body": "<h2>Titanic Centre</h2><p>Titanic Belfast (<a href=\"http://www.titanicbelfast.com/Home.aspx\" title=\"\">titanicbelfast.com</a>, adults £13.50, children £6.75, families £34), housed in a new £97m building in the Titanic Quarter, tells the story of how the ship was built and launched in Belfast. The exhibition has nine interactive galleries – visitors can walk through the original Harland &amp; Wolff shipyard gates, take a six-minute Shipyard Ride through different parts of the ship, with the sounds of riveting and smells of metal burning, and see replicas of the first-, second- and third-class cabins. There's also a glass floor with video footage of the Titanic on the seabed.</p><p>Next door, the Titanic Slipways, where the ship and her sister ship Olympic were built, have been landscaped with lights, grass and decking to show the outlines of the actual ships. A few minutes away is Titanic's Dock and Pump-House (<a href=\"http://www.titanicsdock.com/\" title=\"\">titanicsdock.com</a>, tickets from £5 adults, £3 children, £12 families), where you can peer down into the 880ft graving dock where Titanic sat for her final fit out. The best way to explore the Titanic Quarter is to take a tour – a two-hour walking tour includes access to the Dock and Pump-House and also to the Harland and Wolff drawing offices (0754 648 9874,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.titanicwalk.com\" title=\"\">titanicwalk.com</a>, adults £12, children £5-£8, families £30).&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Titanica exhibition at the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum in Cultra, east of the city, you can also hear audio recordings of stories told by the survivors, and there is an exhibition of some original artefacts that were recovered from the ship, including a porthole and soup tureen (<a href=\"http://www.nmni.com/uftm#TITANICa--The-Exhibition\" title=\"\">nmni.com</a>.from £6.50 per adult and £4 per child, £13-£18.50 families).</p><h2>The MAC</h2><p>On 22 April the MAC arts centre will open&nbsp;with a new play by Belfast-born playwright Owen McCafferty about the Titanic Inquiry. The script of the play, Titanic: Scenes From The British Wreck Commissioner's Inquiry 1912, is based on survivors' testimony given at the inquiry in London. The hearing took 36 days and involved nearly 100 witnesses; this courtroom drama retells some of the human stories of bravery and frailty from the disaster. The Mac is in the buzzy St Anne's Square behind St Anne's Cathedral (see below). <br /><em>• 10 Exchange Street West, St Anne's Square,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://themaclive.com/whats-on/titanic/\" title=\"\"><em>themaclive.com</em></a><em>. Tickets available from 22, 23 and 24 April from £9.50</em></p><h2>Titanic themed pubs and restaurants</h2><p>As well as official events, the city's pubs and restaurants have also jumped on the Titanic bandwagon – with varying degrees of, er, taste. The Merchant Hotel (028-9023 4888, <a href=\"http://www.themerchanthotel.com/index.php/offers-and-events.html\" title=\"\">themerchanthotel.com</a>) has been transformed into a \"ship\", the RMS Merchant, for the month of April. The five-star hotel has nautical bunting and RMS Merchant flags and staff are dressed in nautical uniforms. Guests checking in for the Titanic Experience package will receive a boarding pass with their key card and can have a Gin and Titonic cocktail (oh, yes!) in the \"A-Deck bar\". There's also a nine-course tasting menu based on the flavours of 1912, including dishes such as cold asparagus truffle vinaigrette, poached oysters, champagne and orange sorbet, and turbot and lamb à la Francaise (£85 with recommended wines, £65 without).</p><p>Over at the five-star Culloden Hotel in Holywood, there's a special – wait for it – Sips Ahoy! Titanic Afternoon Tea similar to that served onboard to first-class passengers, with sandwiches, pastries, Harlequin biscuits and Titanic cupcakes (£22 per head, 028-9042 1066, <a href=\"http://www.hastingshotels.com/culloden-estate-and-spa.html\" title=\"\">hastingshotels.com</a>). Also in Holywood, Rayanne House is offering a Titanic banquet  of nine courses, with everything from champagne-laced asparagus to foie gras and truffle and cream of barley soup finished with Bushmills whiskey and cream (£69 per head, various dates, <a href=\"http://www.rayannehouse.com/TitanicMenu.aspx\" title=\"\">rayannehouse.com</a>).</p><h2>The Linen Hall Library</h2><p>Founded in 1788, the Linen Hall, formerly a linen warehouse, is Belfast's oldest library. Entry is free and the cafe is currently running an exhibition of work by Belfast-born artist Terry Bradley, which features striking paintings of the faces of men who worked in the dockyards in Belfast and Dublin 100 years ago. The library also has a small exhibition of Titanic memorabilia and posters on show until 30 April.</p><p>On 19 April, Dr John Welshman, who wrote <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Titanic-Last-Night-Small-Town/dp/0199595577\" title=\"\">Titanic: The Last Night of a Small Town</a> (published last month), will give a talk about the stories of passengers and crew who survived (including the second officer, a first-class governess and a mother in third class) and what happened to them in the years afterwards. <br /><em>• 17 Donegall Square North, free,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.linenhall.com/programme.asp\" title=\"\"><em>linenhall.com</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p><h2>Land Of Giants at the Titanic Slipways</h2><p>Rehearsals are under way for this outdoor summer event which will tell the story of the many giants of Belfast and Northern Ireland – from Finn McCool (the legendary warrior who built the Giant's Causeway) and Jonathan Swift's Gulliver (said to have been inspired by Cavehill which overlooks the city) to the Titanic and Olympic ships and the landmark Harland and Wolff shipyard cranes, also known as Samson and Goliath. The locations have been landscaped and lit to mirror the shape of the two ships that were built there, and a special stage made of shipping containers will be constructed. The audience will stand, divided between the two slipways, and at each end a crane will lift aerial performances into the air.

It's an app recreation of the 50-foot wall installation from a 1961 exhibition called Mathematica, which was sponsored by IBM. The idea: explore the history of maths, going back 1,000 years with ideas, artifacts and mathematician biographies.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/happy-face-parenting-reward/id507423955?mt=8\">The Happy Face</a></h2><p>Struggling with naughty children when on an Easter holiday outing? The Happy Face may help. It's an intuitive rewards app where you move your kids' photos to a happy or sad face, depending on their behaviour. It's the work of UK firm Kent Lyons, with the eight year-old son of its co-founder dreaming up the idea.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/skylanders-cloud-patrol/id511136749?mt=8\">Skylanders Cloud Patrol</a></h2><p>Activision has taken its innovative Skylanders game franchise to iOS, with an arcade shooter that sees players battering trolls, using magic item boosts and importing their favourite Skylander toy characters, just as they do on console.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/toca-kitchen-monsters/id510301841?mt=8\">Toca Kitchen Monsters</a></h2><p>Toca Boca's excellent kid-cooking app Toca Kitchen gets a monstrous free version, with two virtual monsters to feed with sliced, diced and cooked food from a digital kitchen.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/about.me/id500230347?mt=8\">About.me</a></h2><p>About.me started as a web service to pull in information from all your sites and social networking profiles to a one-page biography. Now the idea has gone mobile, including location features to find other users nearby.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.absoluteradio.absoluteextra\">Absolute Radio Extra</a></h2><p>There's a new Android app in town from UK radio group Absolute Radio, offering live streams, podcast archives and other content. It's joined on Google Play by two other new apps too: <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.absoluteradio.absoluteradio70s\">Absolute Radio 70s</a> and <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.absoluteradio.absoluteradio60s\">Absolute Radio 60s</a>.<br /><strong>Android</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/digitalradio/id513783462?mt=8\">DigitalRadio</a></h2><p>Talking of radio, Philips has launched a new iOS app designed to be used when docking an iPhone or iPad with its latest connected hi-fi. That means access to radio stations and your own music collection, as well as related images for the stations and an FM radio mode.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zynga.scramble.paid\">Scramble With Friends</a></h2><p>Zynga's Boggle-alike social game Scramble With Friends was already on Android as a free and ad-funded version, but now there's a paid edition too that removes the ads, and lets players earn tokens twice as fast – a model that matches what's available on iOS.<br /><strong>Android</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/booking.com-tonight-last-minute/id516563800?mt=8\">Booking.com Tonight</a></h2><p>Travel site Booking.com has a new standalone app for last-minute deals on hotels, promising cheap savers from more than 200,000 hotels in 30,000 locations around the world.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/epic-astro-story/id507409247?mt=8\">Epic Astro Story</a></h2><p>Japanese mobile games publisher Kairosoft has a new simulation game, this time set in Space. The idea: build a thriving colony while sending an \"away team\" off to conquer new planets. Star Trek references abound, and it's as addictive as the company's previous titles.<br /><strong>iPhone</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/freekick-battle/id498621488?mt=8\">Freekick Battle</a></h2><p>If Flick Kick Football and Flick Soccer haven't met your need for casual dead-ball action on iOS, Korean publisher Gamevil's new game may be worth a look. In its favour: 3D graphics and bags of personalisation.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/bbc-wildlife-magazine/id484550348?mt=8\">BBC Wildlife Magazine</a></h2><p>Magazine publisher Immediate Media has been on a tear of late making iPad apps for its BBC brands. BBC Wildlife is one of the latest, offering features and photography of local fauna through Apple's iOS Newsstand.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/countryfile-magazine/id485728231?mt=8\">Countryfile Magazine</a> / <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/gardeners-world-magazine/id487737555?mt=8\">Gardener's World Magazine</a></h2><p>I told you they'd been on a tear of late. Here's two more magazine-apps based on much-loved Beeb brands, both using the Newsstand.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/app/tmz-for-ipad/id499734091\">TMZ for iPad</a></h2><p>Only available in the US for now, this is the official iPad app for celebrity gossip site TMZ, providing a popular alternative to Mail Online for all your Kim Kardashian on-the-beach news.<br /><strong>iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/grateful-dead-europe-72-rock/id511897353?mt=8\">Grateful Dead - Europe '72: Rock Prodigy</a></h2><p>Here's an iOS app to teach guitarists to play a selection of Grateful Dead live tracks from 1972, with the app providing feedback on what you play on your actual instrument in real-time. Although the idea of boiling Grateful Dead live tracks down into what are correct and incorrect notes and chords seems slightly... un-freeform.<br /><strong>iPhone / iPad</strong></p><h2><a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ign-guide-for-skyrim-interactive/id508074889?mt=8\">IGN Guide for Skyrim</a></h2><p>Skyrim (probably) isn't coming to iPad any time soon, but there are a number of companion apps for the game popping up on iOS.

          "headline": "New wave of well-off Pakistani women drawn to conservative Islam",
          "body": "<p>All the women working in the information technology division of the Bank of Punjab's headquarters in the western Pakistani city of Lahore wear headscarves tightly wound around their cheeks and chin, framing their faces as they tap at their keyboards. A year or so ago not one covered their heads with the hijab.</p><p>\"I was the first,\" says 28-year-old Shumaila, as she waited with some impatience in the city's iStore for her new £800 Apple MacBook to be loaded with the software she had ordered.</p><p>\"I started reading the Qur'an properly and praying five times a day. No one made me wear the hijab. That would be impossible,\" she laughs brightly. \"I showed the way to the other girls at work.\"</p><p>They are not alone. Though there are no statistics and most evidence is anecdotal, a new wave of interest in more conservative strands of Islam among wealthier and better educated women in Pakistan appears clear.</p><p>It is part of a broader cultural and religious shift seen in the country over  decades but which observers say has accelerated in the past 10 years.</p><p>\"The other girls who were working with us left.\" Shumaila said. \"They found the new environment a bit unfriendly.\"</p><p>One indication of the trend is the growing proportion of women within the conservative religious political organisation Jamaat-e-Islami (JI). Syed Munawar Hassan, the leader of JI in Pakistan, said that women made up an increasing proportion of the organisation's 6 million members and 30,000 organisers. \"Our women's wing is doing very well,\" he said. \"They are some of our best organisers.\"</p><p>JI, like its counterparts elsewhere in the Islamic world, has traditionally recruited among the lower middle class, swollen in recent decades in Pakistan by rapid urbanisation and economic growth. But the new wave of devotion is now touching the elite in a new way. Al-Huda (The Guidance), an organisation set up in 1994 to spread a new and often rigorous piety among Pakistani women, has gained a foothold among the  upper reaches of society.</p><p>The group, which critics accuse of encouraging intolerant strands of Islam influenced by those practised in Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia or Kuwait, has grown from an initial single small centre in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, to a presence in every city, and is expanding among the Pakistani diaspora abroad.</p><p>Members attend intensive courses in Qur'anic studies and Arabic and are directed to do social welfare work, too. Not all enjoy the experience of al-Huda, however.</p><p>\"I found it very limiting and rigid. But it is very popular among women from very wealthy families that are quite conservative. Recently there are a lot of young women coming to a very traditional Islam. There is a deep desire for learning,\" said Maha Jehangir, a 30-year-old consultant and former al-Huda member.</p><p>Jehangir, who lives in a large house in one of the most exclusive parts of Islamabad, said questions posed by the events of the past decade were particularly important for young women.</p><p>\"People who grew up within the war on terror are asking, what does it mean to be a Nato ally? Is India our worst enemy? We are bombarded by all this information and there is a deep need for answers. That leads to religious inquiry,\" Jehangir said.</p><p>Many found the answers in conservative strands of religious practice, she said.</p><p>Other influences that underpin the new piety among wealthy women include the experience of many Pakistanis who have spent time in the Gulf.</p><p>Amna, a 21-year-old business student whose father was a manager for a major firm in Saudi Arabia, said that it was wrong to think that women who were richer or more educated would inevitably be more secular.</p><p>\"Everything we learn comes from the Qur'an. Maths, computers, banking – the Qur'an contains everything,\" said Amna, who wears a Saudi-style full veil covering all but her eyes even at the all-female college in Islamabad where she studies.</p><p>However, if there is a demand for more rigorous, literalist strands of Islamic practice among wealthy and educated women, there is also an interest in more tolerant varieties.</p><p>In Lahore, the <a href=\"http://www.al-mawrid.org/\" title=\"\">al-Mawrid institute</a> is attracting more and more \"educated ladies, doctors, professors, housewives who do not know about Islam\", says Kaukab Shehzad, a 43-year-old teacher.</p><p>The institute, in the wealthy suburb of Model Town, was set up three years ago but had to move after receiving threats from radical scholars, she said. \"We read the Qur'an in detail but we discuss other religions too. We were attacked for saying that the niqab [Saudi-style veil] is not justified in the Qur'anic teachings and for arguing against their interpretation of the idea of jihad,\" she said.</p><p>Though solidarity with Muslim communities overseas is encouraged by many conservative practitioners, many of the new devout shun such a global vision and identity. Shumaila, the bank worker and Apple enthusiast, says she is not interested in events in the Middle East: \"We've enough going on here.\"</p><p>Jahangir, the former al-Huda member in Islamabad, recently spent two years studying in a religious school of the Deobandi branch of Islam, also followed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. A graduate of both Massachusetts and London Universities, she too said that political activism was of little interest: \"I don't try to make sense of the Taliban. I find [them] obscure and irrelevant. For me, [the Deobandi school of Islam] is far more of a route to spirituality than a political ideology.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/world&k=Pakistan&k=Islam&k=Religion&k=Women&k=World+news&k=Life+and+style\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/world/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=New+wave+of+well-off+Pakistani+women+drawn+to+conservative+Islam+Article+1721629&ch=World+news&c2=148491&c4=Pakistan+%28News%29%2CIslam+%28News%29%2CReligion+%28News%29%2CWomen+and+women%27s+interests%2CWorld+news%2CLife+and+style&c3=guardian.co.uk&c6=Jason+Burke+in+Lahore&c7=12-Apr-09&c8=1721629&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: world/2012/apr/09/pakistani-women-conservative-islam|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|9fd1eb1e86f2f5ed1cefc2c35b86f0bef6ac7375 -->",

So here it is.</p><blockquote><p>Manchester United have won 10 of their past 11 league games and drawn the other, not only displaying the sort of precisely timed acceleration that defines champions but giving their rivals an object lesson in team unity and professional focus. While United have moved five points clear at the top of the Premier League, Manchester City have been one of the sides caught arguing among themselves, with disappointing results leading to signs of dissent on and off the pitch.</p><p>It could be argued that good results promote team harmony, and vice versa, though even in adversity, or the occasions such as Monday evening at Blackburn when the leaders had to wait 80 minutes for a breakthrough, squabbling among United players is rare.</p><p>\"I wouldn't allow it,\" Sir Alex Ferguson says, speaking with all the authority of a manager who has faced down internal criticism from Roy Keane, Jaap Stam and others in his time. Even those cases tended to happen away from the pitch, in television studios or books. United players conspicuously fight for each other on the pitch, they do not turn on each other.</p></blockquote><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>The teams are in! </strong>And they look very much like this:<br /><strong>Manchester United:</strong> De Gea, Rafael Da Silva, Ferdinand, Evans, Evra, Valencia, Scholes, Carrick, Young, Rooney, Welbeck. <strong>Subs: </strong>Amos, Jones, Giggs, Park, Hernández, Cleverley, Pogba. <br /><strong>QPR:</strong> Kenny, Onuoha, Ferdinand, Hill, Taiwo, Diakite, Derry, Mackie, Taarabt, Buzsaky, Bothroyd. <strong>Subs: </strong>Cerny, Gabbidon, Campbell, Young, Smith, Wright-Phillips, Zamora. <br /><strong>Referee: </strong>Lee Mason.</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.00pm:</span> <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/soundway-records/another-one-bites-the-dust-los\">Song of the day:</a> A good choice for this one should probably reflect Manchester United's potentially title-winning current form, and it might be a bonus if it came from South America, to emphasise the central role in that form played by their on-fire Ecuadorian winger Antonio Valencia. And so, from neighbouring Colombia, I offer you <em><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/soundway-records/another-one-bites-the-dust-los\">Otro Muerde El Polvo</a></em> by Los Miticos Del Ritmo, an instrumental cumbia cover of a tub-thumping English rock classic (of sorts). It's not even out yet, that's how on the button I am. Don't thank me.</p><p>If you do happen to like that, try <a href=\"http://grooveshark.com/s/Sinfonia+Agridulce/2GoCD0?src=5\">this</a>, a mariachi cover of a laid-back English indie classic. A couple of years old, but just excellent.</p><p>Anyway, shall we talk football?</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.16pm:</span> So Nani's much-trumpeted comeback from injury takes him only as far as the stands. Javier Hernández, who I thought had quite a poor game against Blackburn on Monday, is replaced by Danny Welbeck, with Ashley Young also coming into the side in polace of Phil Jones. QPR start Jay Bothroyd for the first time since January.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.19pm:</span> Mark Hughes explains that Joey Barton is out of the squad because he's on nine bookings and they don't want him suspended.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.26pm:</span> \"Well they're better choices for songs than the one I thought of when seeing the photo of the managers – Depeche Mode's Master and Servant,\" writes Gary Naylor, as the teams come out. \"I suspect there'll be a little of that songs S (if not M) meted out today at Old Trafford.\"</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><span class=\"timestamp\">1.27pm:</span> \"That is quite a scary photo you have there,\" writes Robin Hazlehurst (picture repeated left, for those who turn up after I've changed the main one). \"Please tell me they weren't facing each other at the time. Although if they were, it is notable that Ferguson is looking unfaithfully over Hughes' left shoulder, possibly eyeing up his next dance partner.\"</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>1 min:</strong> Peeeeeeep! They're off!</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>2 mins:</strong> QPR haven't left their own half, and United have their first kind-of-chance, a free-kick after Clint Hill brought down Welbeck 20-odd yards out. Rooney and Young stand over it.</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>3 mins:</strong> Rooney shoots, and the ball hits the head of Anton Ferdinand at the end of the wall and flies wide.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>5 mins:</strong> Another corner from Ashley Young; the keeper comes but gets nowhere near it. It's headed away. \"Do you suppose 1.19pm's Mark Hughes realises that, no matter how long he rests him, Joey Barton will still be on nine bookings next time he plays?\" asks Mac Milling. There's a yellow-card amnesty approaching, I believe.</p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>6 mins:</strong> And United's barrage continues. If this is QPR's gameplan it's a rubbish one. Another free-kick, another shot from Rooney and this one is on its way in until Paddy Kenny flies across his goal to turn it wide.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>8 mins: </strong>United have had 92% of possession in these first seven minutes. Another key question. \"We all know that footballers aren't allowed to get bevvied and turkied up at Christmas (and people say they have an easy life) but does anyone know if they're still allowed to gobble Easter Eggs today, or if club nutritionists and the like frown on such decadence?\" asks Ryan Dunne. I believe they are allowed an occasional Easter egg, so long as it is poached and not fried or scrambled.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>9 mins: </strong>QPR have just kicked the ball in United's half, several times. It ended with a decent crossing chance for Nedum Onuoha, which he rather fluffed.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>11 mins: </strong>Toph Taylor has had the time to look up what I couldn't, and provides the relevant paragraph of Premier League regulations concerning the yellow card amnesty:</p><blockquote><p><br />(iii) If a Player accumulates ten cautions in FTCM between the opening day of the Playing Season and the second Sunday of April in the same Season, he will be suspended automatically for a period covering:- Two First Team matches</p></blockquote><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>13 mins:</strong> Rooney touches the ball into the path of Welbeck, inside the penalty area, but it was a very pacy touch requiring perfect instant control, which Welbeck didn't quite pull off.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>14 mins: </strong><strong>PENALTY! RED CARD!</strong> Rooney passes the ball into the path of Ashley Young, running into the penalty area. He was two yards offside when the pass was made, and then dived over Shaun Derry's not-that-muscular challenge.</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 1 QPR 0 (Rooney, 15 mins)</strong> Rooney shoots low and hard to the goalkeeper's right. Kenny goes the right way, but still can't touch it.</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>16 mins: </strong>An abysmal decision by the referee's assistant not to give the offside, and a poor one by the referee to award the penalty, in my opinion.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>19 mins:</strong> Hill fouls Welbeck again – not much in it, to be fair. Ashley Young shoots into the wall. It's all about the goal difference now, surely. And about the FA charge Mark Hughes will get when he inevitably tells the lino how rubbish his decision was, using a television camera as an intermediary.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>20 mins:</strong> Young's every touch now getting booed by the travelling fans.</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>21 mins:</strong> A QPR shot! Taarabt with it, a good 30 yards out, but it strikes Carrick's foot and flies over the bar.</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>24 mins: MISS!</strong> Rooney tries to play in Valencia, gives the ball to Taiwo, takes it back again and then crosses to the near post, where Ashley Young meets the ball but heads across goal and wide.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>27 mins: </strong>\"It was offside, but its a penalty and red card instead,\" fumes Kiki, as Rooney's goalbound shot from Valencia's pass is well blocked. \"You gotta be ******* kidding me. **** the premiere league! **** the refs! Every week there's this kinda ********! PS Forward this to FA will ya.\"</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>30 mins: </strong>United are probing gently in search of No2, inevitably focusing their attacks down the right wing. \"Can I just say, as a Red Manc of four decades' standing, that it's decisions like that which give all the ABUs and conspiracy theorists ammunition, isn't it?\" writes Greg Scully. \"Never a pen, and definitely not a red. And it doesn't look like we were gonna need the help, so it just sullies what should be an incredible achievement, in the event that we do lift title #20 this year.\"</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>32 mins: </strong>Taarabt gets into the penalty area, takes the ball round Rafael but then sees his shot blocked by the sliding Evans. Sky replay the penalty incident. It really is a horrific triple-whammy of abysmal decision-making. I think the only fair thing the Premier League can do in the circumstances is to allow Manchester City to start their game at Arsenal with a 1-0 lead.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>36 mins: </strong>Rooney shoots from 22 yards, and the ball was heading towards the top corner, if not at any great pace, before Kenny plucks it out of the air. In the last 10 minutes I've had emails from furious QPR fans, emails from embarrassed United fans, and emails from apoplectic neutrals. Here's the first in defence of the referee: \"The fact is without the offside call from the assistant he had to give the penalty and the red card,\" insists John. \"Derry did put his hand on Young, and even an exagerrated dive cannot save him. Lee Mason won't be happy with his assistant though.\" I think that's a generous interpretation. There may have been contact between the players, but contact alone does not make a foul – there has to be more than that.</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>38 mins: </strong>Valencia crosses from the right, Welbeck at the far post heads over. \"Something must be done about diving,\" rages Malcolm. \"Surely there is a case for video evidence post match. Derry's card should be rescinded and Young banned for four games. The goal should be deducted from the final score and any points adjusted accordingly.\" I'm all in favour of video evidence being used post-match to punish clear cheating, but think that unless there are more camera angles out there this particular incident would, in cricketing parlance, go down as a \"referee's call\".</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>42 mins: </strong>\"Ashley Young is English. And English players get an easier ride compared to the foreign players,\" says Martin Tyler on Fox, according to Ali Kinnaird. I don't think he's wrong: I don't see why Young's reputation should be any better than that of, say, Suárez or before him Di Canio, who both seem to have been swiftly tagged by referees as divers and could scarcely buy a penalty thereafter.</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>45 mins: </strong>United have been perfectly capable since that goal, working hard to win possession and working it well around the penalty area, but QPR have been equally industrious in denying them chances. \"That United goal if anything just delegitimises their championship,\" writes Liam Harris. \"They've had abysmal performances in all four other competitions they've been in, and now the 'myth' that they get 'the benefit of the doubt' from refs at Old Trafford emerges again. It's not great when you've got one team trying to buy their way to the title and the other trying to cheat their way, and Chelsea trying to do both but still failing.\"</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>45 mins:</strong> We'll have a single minute of stoppage time here. Scholes celebrates by thwacking a 30-yarder well wide.</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>45+1 mins:</strong> Peeeeeep! It's half-time, and QPR fans greet the whistle with a lusty chorus of boos.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>Half-time:</strong> I'm going to draw a line under the penalty incident now. It's happened. We'll hear a lot more about it later, I'm sure. I plan to enjoy the second half as if it never happened. And I don't <em>really</em> think City should be allowed to start their game with a one-goal advantage (though I do think that life would be better if there was a way of reacting to such vital and clearly incorrect decisions that was a little more convincing and meaningful than just shrugging and saying that it evens itself out over a season).</p><p>United have played well, but as is often the case they looked more likely to score in those first 15 minutes, when they were totally dominant, than in the half-hour they played against 10 men. They've had nothing but two headed half-chances since, one from Young at the near post and one from Welbeck at the far, both from Valencia crosses.</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>46 mins:</strong> Peeeeeeep! They're off! Again!</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>46 mins:</strong> United immediately on the attack again, and Rooney and Young both have shots blocked within a minute of the restart.</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>47 mins:</strong> United have a goal disallowed! Valencia crosses low and hard, and Welbeck is probably a foot offside as he taps it in.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>49 mins:</strong> Ashley Young's lovely backheel plays Welbeck in, but his shot flies over the bar.</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>54 mins:</strong> Rooney's low, hard drive from just outside the area is well held by Kenny.</p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>56 mins: </strong>Diakité's long-range shot skids wide, helped on its way by a deflection. QPR have had the best of the last couple of minutes. \"My problem with QPR is that you simply can't see them as a plucky underdog,\" writes Michael Hunt. \"They appear to the casual snap-judging football opinion-maker (Hi there!) to be a small club in comparison to their more illustrious opponents this season, and yet the owners and the ludicrous money spent on mediocrity means that they don't get any sympathy. You can't root for them to bring it back, even against United.\" Clearly QPR are the least loveable of the three promoted sides this season, and also, by happy coincidence, the least successful.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>57 mins:</strong> Down the other end, and another shot from distance, this by Scholes, flies wide. Talking of which. \"It seems to me that these days Scholes hardly ever heeds the exhortations of the crowd to SHOOOOOT! from distance,\" writes Ian Childs. \"Efforts from distance seem really rare from Scholes these days, as he almost always to elects to keep the ball moving. Does anyone have any stats on Scholes' long shooting since his return?\"</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>49 mins:</strong> Incredible save! Rafael bursts into the QPR penalty area and is found unmarked and entirely on his own by Scholes's excellent pass. A goal seems inevitable, but the shot clips off the keeper and thuds against the bar.</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>61 mins:</strong> A lovely reverse pass by Rooney finds Welbeck steaming into the penalty area, but his first-time left-foot shot is poor and straight at Kenny, and his follow-up effort, hit while off-balance, is easily caught.</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>63 mins:</strong> Ryan Giggs has replaced Ashley Young, and darn nearly gets his head on another Valencia cross in a certain-goalscoring position straight away.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>65 mins: </strong>This from @OptaJoe on Twitter at half-time: \"Michael Carrick (81) &amp; Paul Scholes (76) made 157 passes between them in the first half, 39 more than the whole QPR team.\"</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>GOAL! Manchester United 2 QPR 0 (Scholes, 68 mins) </strong>Bad news for Ian Childs' credibility, as Scholes takes yet another shot from range. Teed up by Rafael, he sends the ball arrowing into the bottom left corner of the goal, from about 25 yards. No doubt about that one.</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>71 mins: </strong>QPR substitutions: Tommy Smith and Shaun Wright-Phillips replace Adel Taarabt, who gifted United possession in the run-up to the second goal, and Samba Diakité.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>73 mins:</strong> United replace Scholes with Tom Cleverley, and bring Phil Jones on for Rafael, who had just been booked, apparently for falling over.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>77 mins: </strong>WOWEE! A patient United attack ends with Evra passing the ball inside to Carrick, whose shot from a good 40 yards thuds into the post. \"Given Ian Childs' delicious tempting of fate re: Scholes' long-range shooting, is there any chance he could write an email along the lines of 'Can anyone remember the last time Arsenal scored 14 goals in a game?'\" asks Greg Scully.</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>80 mins: </strong>Another substitution: QPR bring DJ Campbell on for England's Jay Bothroyd.</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>83 mins: </strong>QPR chief executive Phil Beard on Twitter: \"Difficult to take after watching numerous replays but Ashley Young could partner Tom Daley at the Olympics. #QPR\"</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>85 mins:</strong> Not much by way of tempo in this game now. United are controlling possession, the game is won, and QPR have their minds on Wednesday's match against Swansea. Cleverley has a shot deflected wide.</p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>88 mins: </strong>The teams from the Emirates, for those who are interested: <strong>Arsenal: </strong>Szczesny, Sagna, Koscielny, Vermaelen, Gibbs, Arteta, Song, Walcott, Rosicky, Benayoun, van Persie. Subs: Fabianski, Andre Santos, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Ramsey, Djourou, Jenkinson, Chamakh. <strong>Man City: </strong>Hart, Zabaleta, Kompany, Lescott, Clichy, Touré Yaya, Barry, Milner, Aguero, Nasri, Balotelli. Subs: Pantilimon, Richards, Pizarro, Dzeko, Kolarov, Tevez, De Jong. <strong>Referee:</strong> Martin Atkinson.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>90 mins:</strong> We'll have three minutes of stoppage time.</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>90+2 mins:</strong> United keep possession for long enough for me to start writing that they'll play out the rest of the match in their own half, and then sweep forward. Cleverley curls a shot wide from the edge of the area.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>90+3 mins:</strong> Peeeeeeep! It's all over. United open up an eight-point lead over Manchester City, for a couple of hours at the very least.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>Final thoughts: </strong>United were always likely to win this. Not just in prospect: they utterly dominated the opening exchanges. In all likelihood it made little difference to this match that the breakthrough came from a penalty that shouldn't have been given, involving a player who was offside, resulting in an extremely harsh red card. Had united thereafter swept 10-man QPR aside with a scintilating display of attacking greatness, it could almost have been forgotten. But that didn't happen, and it won't be. Lee Mason should be on the receiving end of a helluva rollicking at some point shortly, and his assistant will presumably be manning League Two touchlines with that bloke from Chelsea v Wigan for the remainder of the season.</p><p>Over, then, to Manchester City.

          "headline": "If only Holyrood appreciated woman",
          "body": "<p>Attempting to plot the exact time when the decline and fall of the Labour party in Scotland began is a difficult exercise. There are some who believe the party signed its own execution warrant simply by its enthusiasm for the devolution project. Donald Dewar's subsequent unholy inquisition in which he ensured that only the \"right sort\" would be deemed worthy of selection for the first diet of Holyrood has similarly had disastrous consequences for Labour. It meant that when the party ceded power to the SNP in 2007 there were depressingly few politicians of sufficient calibre to challenge what was a formidable array of talent and experience on the nationalist side.</p><p>Alex Salmond and his inner sanctum of acolytes and devotees has proved to be comfortable in possession. The principle members of his cabinet have survived more or less intact after five years of power. In the decade before they took Holyrood, there were few occasions when Sturgeon, Swinney, MacAskill, Hyslop and even the maverick Russell were not acting in concert and refining their plan of action for the first 100 days of eventual SNP government. Yet on those fleeting occasions when they have dropped the ball, Labour has also been found wanting in pressing home the advantage. Their utter defenestration and humiliation in 2011 at the hands of a hardened and efficient government machine was inevitable.</p><p>On the day Iain Gray finally demitted office and Salmond patronised him and ruffled his hair he must then have appreciated how a Motherwell manager feels when an Old Firm boss approaches him at the end of another wretched cup final. For Labour supporters, it doesn't get much worse than this. And when Johann Lamont, the Labour member for Glasgow Pollok, was elected to succeed Gray it seemed that, for Scottish Labour, the party was finally over.</p><p>Lamont is a woman for whom commentators will reach for words such as \"redoubtable\", \"formidable\" or \"busy\". What they really mean is that they would normally expect to encounter someone like her foraging for comestibles in Tesco. That she represents one of Glasgow's edgier arrondissements completes the picture. Yet that is partly where her strength lies. There was a time, before Blair, Mandelson and Miliband hijacked the party, when a person such as Johann Lamont would have epitomised all that Labour represented: hard work, honesty, aspiration, integrity and compassion. She is Labour incarnate and her slogan might simply be: \"No nonsense\".</p><p>Even so, it was feared that, for all these qualities, she would simply be swept aside in debate with Alex Salmond. For the last 10 years or so, he has forsaken breakfast most Thursday mornings in the knowledge that he will have a Labour leader, seasoned and garnished, before the day is out. Ms Lamont, though, has risen to the challenge of facing him. She has rarely been bested at first minister's questions and has taken care in choosing the ground on which to engage her party's nemesis. She comes well prepared and does not lose her equanimity when the first minister's mouth assumes its default aspect which is halfway between a smirk and a snort.</p><p>Even in her bad moments, she retains her composure and emerges with dignity. One of these occurred two weeks ago in an exchange about education. The SNP's sorcery when it quotes numbers in any discussion about learning is well known. If you listen for long enough to Mike Russell, the education minister, you may form the impression that every pupil in Scotland will become a doctor of philosophy by the time the nationalists have done with them. Lamont had talked about a nursery nurse for every child when she ought actually to have said that each child should have access to one. Salmond pounced in characteristic style, but in so doing merely sounded like a supercilious and hectoring bully. Ms Lamont is underneath his skin.</p><p>The new Labour leader's nerveless performances in the chamber have illuminated a curious phenomenon in Scottish Labour since 1999 and one that should make the party pause for reflection. With the exception of Jack McConnell and, to a lesser extent, Henry McLeish, Labour's real stars at Holyrood have all been women. Susan Deacon's performance at health in the first Holyrood Labour administration has never since been bettered, though Nicola Sturgeon is currently giving her a run for her money. McConnell, though, banished Deacon to the back-benches in reprisal for her failing to back him in the contest that gave him the leadership. Wendy Alexander, like Deacon, is also possessed of a fierce and acute intellect yet chose to resign as Labour leader for a minor fiscal infraction of which she'd had no knowledge. Holyrood is diminished by the continuing absence of these two.</p><p>And you have to wonder why Margaret Curran and Cathy Jamieson are ossifying within the most under-worked and irrelevant political grouping anywhere in the UK: the Scottish Labour group at Westminster. If these four had been occupying the senior frontbench places that their talents and experience deserved, then Scottish Labour would not currently be staring into the abyss. A lack of vision and an absence of strategic leadership meant that their rightful places are currently being filled by the eager and the busy, but sadly also the woebegotten.</p><p>What is it in the psyche of a substantial number of Scottish men that makes them fear and loathe women with brains? Joan McAlpine, the first minister's parliamentary liaison officer, will climb high within the SNP, but she is already finding out that being a woman with an intellect brings you grief both within and without your party. And if you think Nicola Sturgeon has escaped this then just wait until she tries to succeed Salmond as leader of the SNP.</p><p>For the moment, Johann Lamont need not concern herself with this. She is the unopposed mistress of Labour's destiny. And in her bustling and no-nonsense form, the old parties of the United Kingdom may just have found an unlikely champion as they fight to preserve the Union.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/commentisfree&k=Scottish+National+party+%28SNP%29&k=Alex+Salmond&k=Scotland&k=Politics&k=UK+news&k=Labour\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/commentisfree/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=If+only+Holyrood+appreciated+woman+%7C+Kevin+McKenna+Article+1728412&ch=Comment+is+free&c2=148491&c4=SNP+%28Politics%29%2CAlex+Salmond%2CScotland+%28News%29%2CPolitics%2CUK+news%2CLabour&c3=The+Observer&c6=Kevin+McKenna&c7=12-Apr-07&c8=1728412&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: commentisfree/2012/apr/08/alex-salmond-holyrood-johann-lamont|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|315f4e4cbc0446f791e3ec37906cd817f4002701 -->",

          "headline": "The pleasures of rereading",
          "body": "<p>It usually starts with a pretence of steeliness. Not the whole thing, I'll tell myself, reaching for the ruined paperback. One chapter, a favourite passage, then I'll wedge it back in with those books begun but not yet finished; the dozens more bought or inherited that I honestly mean to open, sooner to get to all of Dickens. I'm a chronic rereader, mostly of novels, and it is a habit as coiled with guilt as it  is with pleasure, because every go-round with  a favourite is also another time I haven't read <em>Bleak House</em>.</p><p>The trouble is that a chapter or passage is never enough. The same qualities that seduced once seduce again. I've had watertight plans to parachute in at one of <em>Brideshead Revisited</em>'s irresistible mealtime scenes, read, and get out again; plans ruined by the compulsion to flick back a page, back a chapter – gah – back to the prologue. <em>The Go-Between</em> is my private demon. An innocent reminder, I'll think, how LP Hartley phrased his famous opening line… suddenly it's midnight and I'm 100 pages deep and Ted is oiling his shotgun.</p><p>The affliction struck early. For me, as for many kids of the 80s, novels were pitiful things if not written by Roald Dahl, and aged 10 or so I met the unusual dilemma of exhausting an author's catalogue. With <em>Matilda</em>, <em>The Witches</em> and the rest devoured, only Dahl's intimidating stream of adult stories and the latterly published <em>Esio Trot </em>were left. I thumbed through <em>Trot</em>, dismayed that it didn't have any obvious chocolate factories or marvellous medicines, instead a couple of moony pensioners and a tortoise. I supposed I could try it. Or (the option seemed amazing, possibly illegal) why not restart one of my favourites?</p><p>I haven't gone back to <em>Esio Trot</em> yet, and every reread since that first shaky reach for <em>Matilda</em> has been tinged with the same concern: that to refuse the new is to break some elemental code of literature. That to reread is lazy, maybe even impolite. So I've faked anticipation when somebody spots the paperback I'm carrying and says that I'll love Cecil when he appears in <em>A Room With a View</em> or that <em>Any Human Heart</em> gets very, very sad. I've thought about folding the dust-jacket of a pristine Mrs Gaskell around a battered Martin Amis, just to avoid a friend or relative asking: \"Again?\"</p><p>Examples mentioned here are personal. The novels that yoke the rereader are not universal – they're not always good. Some of the motivations and satisfactions, though, must be shared.</p><p>It is time travel, a reliable way to reawaken feelings sparked by a book at first encounter. George MacDonald Fraser's series of Flashman novels summons for me an early stretch at university, when I picked up one in a stranger's room, skimmed a paragraph, and realised with excitement and dread that my set-text reading plan would now implode. <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> brings back a thrilling first sense of professional life and the daily commute, Orwell's novel finished while travelling across town for work experience at 15. Salinger's slim book of stories will forever be a ski-trip coach that smelled not unpleasantly of Chewits; <em>Laughter in the Dark</em> a summer spent dumped and misanthropic and grateful for Nabokov's mean wit. <em>Howard's End</em> is the time I met my wife, opened every year since.</p><p>Security is a factor. Max Beerbohm's <em>Zuleika Dobson</em> was funny when last picked up and can fairly be expected to have stayed that way on the shelf. No need to gamble on new characters or a new set of circumstances – abstentions that for some would void the chief appeal of fiction are for the rereader a lure, because that massive investment of hours can be made without risk of disappointment. The last page of Steinbeck's brick-sized <em>East of Eden</em> will unfailingly thrill me. I sweat through Tom Ripley's police interviews every time.</p><p>Actually, those nervy near-arrests in <em>The Talented Mr Ripley</em> are a bit of an exception. Suspense is the first thing to die on a reread, and the experience is better for it. Familiar with the story, the plot on rails, the rereader can relax, look around and whistle at the scenery. I first read Marilynne Robinson's <em>Gilead</em> racked by an irrational fear that the old and ill narrator was going to croak on every next page. Only during a second and third read could I properly absorb Robinson's gentle wisdom.</p><p>Even when it gets silly (a fourth reread, a fifth, pages tugged loose and the book plump with place-holding Travelcards), old favourites can surprise. On a sixth or seventh lap of <em>The Go-Between</em>, I finally paid proper heed to Marcus Maudsley, that fantastic little shit of an 11-year-old who has all the polished procedural snobbery of a Victorian ancient. A bit-player once ignored, now treasured.</p><p>I wonder if Hartley intended Marcus to be a slow burner. Some novelists definitely anticipate the rereader and lay rewards. Nabokov slaps an outrageous spoiler on page two of <em>Lolita</em>, detectable only if you've finished it before. At the beginning of the first Harry Potter book (guilty), there's throwaway mention of a character who won't appear for two more sequels. The novelists might be rereaders themselves, this their show of fellowship. Or perhaps it's authorial swagger – confident assertion that, yeah, this is one of <em>those</em> books. The sort the rereader thwaps shut with a grunt, already reaching for Scotch Tape to strengthen the spine, smugly pondering the £7.99 investment that'll pay back again in two years, in four…</p><p>To freshen my memory before writing this, I carefully explored my book shelves, alert for scuffed bindings, squeezing paperbacks for the tell-tale crackle of sand and crisp-crumb. They weren't all there, my stalwarts, but I found them – some in a pile by the sofa, a few kicked under the bed, one hidden away in an old shoulder-bag. I'd seized them up when last ill or bored or moody or restless, in need of comfort.</p><p>Rereading is therapy, despite the accompanying dash of guilt, and I find it strange that not everybody does it. Why wouldn't you go back to something good? I return to these novels for the same reason I return to beer, or blankets or best friends.</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/books&k=Fiction&k=Books&k=Culture&k=Best+books&k=Roald+Dahl&k=Vladimir+Nabokov\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/books/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/books/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=The+pleasures+of+rereading+Article+1727537&ch=Books&c2=148491&c4=Fiction+%28Books+genre%29%2CBooks%2CCulture%2CBest+books%2CRoald+Dahl%2CVladimir+Nabokov+%28Author%29%2CEM+Forster+%28Author%29&c3=The+Observer&c6=Tom+Lamont&c7=12-Apr-07&c8=1727537&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: books/2012/apr/08/rereading-favourite-books-pleasure|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|e28c0735b23d73934f3592e9068995aea3bf10b9 -->",

This fifth album is arguably his most measured, setting his supple vocals to acoustic, subtly innovative arrangements. Dark-hued ballads take prominence and allow his flair for the tender and dramatic to shine. \"The Captain's Apprentice\" has a maritime, Brittanesque atmosphere, ghostly clanks attend \"The 18th of June\", while the stately \"Lord Douglas\" comes with accordion and pedal steel. By contrast, Anaïs Mitchell's \"If It's True\" gets a theatrical, orchestral treatment and a banjo-flaying version of Fleetwood Mac's \"Big Love\" is a surprising winner. A slow-burn delight. <strong> </strong></p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/music&k=Folk+music&k=Music&k=Culture\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/music/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=Jim+Moray%3A+Skulk+%E2%80%93+review+Article+1727356&ch=Music&c2=148491&c4=Folk+music+%28Music+genre%29%2CMusic%2CCulture&c3=The+Observer&c6=Neil+Spencer&c7=12-Apr-07&c8=1727356&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: music/2012/apr/08/jim-moray-skulk-review|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|1aea1a5bf0946c57cdb77622e5a1e86a8098be39 -->",

          "headline": "James Haskell scours globe to enrich his game en route back to Wasps",
          "body": "<p>If you should ever fancy an airgun pellet between the shoulder blades, you could do worse than cavort through the backcountry around Dunedin shouting, \"Woo-hoo, The Hask!\" The chances are you will tweak the nerves of James Haskell, who will almost certainly be out hunting somewhere nearby, armed with said weapon and urged on by Andrew Hore and his other new team-mates at the Highlanders.</p><p>\"Please don't refer to me as The Hask,\" he says politely, but with a clear undertone. Then he complains they all call him that in Dunedin, the latest city he calls home, before launching into an explanation of the provenance of a nickname he considers a travesty. It's something to do with a perception that he promotes himself as a brand.</p><p>It is true that he has his own website and is an avid user of social media, but for all his love of gadgets and techno-geekery there is something very old-fashioned about him as well. For a start, there's his proclivity for lying low in the wilderness of the South Island alongside grizzled All Black front-row forwards.</p><p>\"Andrew Hore is a big one for shooting,\" says Haskell. \"He describes it as doing a few jobs, so he'll come up to me and say, 'I've got a few jobs on. You interested?' Last time it was some rabbit shooting, a bit of pest clearance on the farm of a friend of his, with him and Jamie MacKintosh [the Highlanders captain and a prop forward capped by the All Blacks].\"</p><p>And then there's the fact that Haskell is to be found on the other side of the world at all, when every other English back-row forward of his calibre and generation is to be found up here, fighting for a place in the national team.</p><p>Haskell is ambitious, but not to the exclusion of everything else. His stint with the Highlanders in the Super 15 is the last leg of a three-year odyssey that has also taken him to Paris and Tokyo, before he returns to Wasps next season, the club where it all started. Never let it be said that he is shy of the more glamorous aspects of his profession, but this journey smacks more of a passion to see the world and to live life.</p><p>\"It takes a lot of sacrifices to come over here. You're leaving your friends and family to go to a place where you don't know anyone. Financially, over here it's a&nbsp;very different ball game. The money just isn't competitive, so you have to make it a purely rugby decision. And you've got to give up your England place. So I don't think this will become a common move.\"</p><p>Ah, his England place. It might have been forgotten – amid all the recent excitement over England's ascension from \"the gutter\", as Graham Rowntree put it – that their growing stock of options in the back row will soon be supplemented further by the return of Haskell. England's descent into the depths was so vertiginous and so quickly reversed that it is tempting to ask whether it ever really happened. As someone who has seen England from the inside and out in recent times, Haskell's a good person to ask.</p><p>\"It is up to Wig [Rowntree], his choice of words, but it was a difficult period of time. People made mistakes. But the problem with anything in life is that if you just focus on the media, without any inside knowledge of what went on, you naturally have a biased opinion. Everyone wanted an England team to be proud of [at the World Cup] and they were disappointed. If you took everything that was written at face value — that the guys were on a stag do and so on — then it helped to compound the problems and put English rugby into a dark place. But with the new coaches it's on the way up again and back to where it should be. Guys are focused on performance and the talk is about the rugby, and nothing else.\"</p><p>Haskell did not get to watch much of the Six Nations and what he did see was in highlights packages. Kick-off times in the northern hemisphere make it very difficult for those in New Zealand to follow rugby up here and this is reflected in their indifference towards it. There is an amusing video on the internet in which Haskell asks some of his Highlanders team-mates their opinions of northern-hemisphere rugby. The more mischievous (Hore, for example) use it as a chance to indulge in banter about how boring it is, but all of them confess to not knowing because they never watch any of it. This is one&nbsp;of several cultural differences Haskell has had to embrace during his recent adventures.</p><p>\"It's interesting. You ask people in England what they think of Super 15, they'll have a lot more comments than the other way round. That's what I've always found with Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. They just focus on what they're doing, whereas in the UK we look outwards more. Talking to the guys who are All Blacks, when they're preparing for an international they do some analysis on patterns of play, but they don't focus on the minutiae of their opponents. Some players might disagree, but I reckon if you asked an All Black after a game who his opposite number was, most of the time he wouldn't know, unless it was someone like Jonny Wilkinson.\"</p><p>After the World Cup, Haskell went to Japan to play alongside Ma'a Nonu and Tamati Ellison for Ricoh Black Rams for a few months. He describes Japanese rugby as the fastest he has ever played. The players are so well drilled that skill levels are higher than in the Top 14 in France, where you might see 10 or 15 balls go down in a Stade Français training session. But the French are infused with their natural flair and a ferocious devotion to physicality. Their emotions fluctuate wildly. Japanese emotions can run high too, but they are tempered by the attention to drills. In New Zealand, the approach is more recognisable to an Anglo-Saxon one, but they are blessed with a culture that promotes touch rugby from a young age, with less focus on weights and conditioning.</p><p>After such an experience, Haskell will surely return to England a better player than he was when he left on a two-year deal with Stade Français in 2009, and it is to his credit that he has seen fit to embark on such an adventure. It was noticeable how improved his form for England was in the 2011 Six Nations, courtesy of his French sojourn, and Wasps (in particular) and England will wait with interest to see how he returns from his subsequent stints in Japan and New Zealand.</p><p>\"I wanted to play Super 15. I wanted to develop some maturity, some leadership and to work on my skill set. Also I want to have played all round the world. Then you can come to informed opinions. People make very many comments in life when they don't have the background or the knowledge. I'll be able to tell you what it's like in four of the big leagues in the rugby world. I've had a great experience. I've played with some of the best players in the world, and I've loved every minute of it.\"</p><div class=\"gu_advert\">\n        <iframe marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"NO\" width=\"300px\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"http://resource.guim.co.uk/global/adcode/generatehtml?slot=Bottom&partner=guardianapis.com/sport&k=England+rugby+union+team&k=New+Zealand+rugby+union+team&k=Stade+Fran%C3%A7ais&k=Rugby+union&k=Sport\" style=\"border: none\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250px\">\n          <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/click_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom\">\n              <img alt=\"Ads by The Guardian\" src=\"http://oas.guardian.co.uk/RealMedia/ads/adstream_nx.ads/guardianapis.com/sport/oas.html/@Bottom\"></img>\n          </a>\n        </iframe>\n      </div><img src='http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-api/1/H.20.3/98867?ns=guardian&pageName=James+Haskell+scours+globe+to+enrich+his+game+en+route+back+to+Wasps+%7C+Michael+Aylwin+Article+1728430&ch=Sport&c2=148491&c4=England+rugby+union+team%2CNew+Zealand+rugby+union+team%2CStade+Francais+%28Rugby+union%29%2CRugby+union%2CSport&c3=The+Observer&c6=Michael+Aylwin&c7=12-Apr-07&c8=1728430&c9=Article' width='1' height='1' /><!-- Guardian Watermark: sport/2012/apr/07/james-haskell-england-new-zealand-rugby|2012-04-13T11:30:50Z|a23f98449e1e904bddb9bbdd1fa78361a283af59 -->",

          "body": "<!-- Block 1 --><p><strong>Preamble</strong> It was never a problem. Chasing small totals, it was never a problem. England could be hope-shreddingly inept at everything else if they liked but, <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;innings_number=4;orderby=start;qualmax1=149;qualval1=target;result=2;spanmin2=15+Mar+1977;spanval2=span;team=2;template=results;type=team;view=innings\">unlike those mentally weak Aussies</a>, they knew how to knock off small totals. Between 1903 and 2011, England had a target of between 100 and 149 to win a Test on 26 occasions. Their record was almost perfect: W23 D2 L1. Twice they ran out of time; once, famously, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63203.html\">they were Hadleed in Christchurch</a>.</p><p>Then Abu Dhabi happened. England did not just fail to reach a target of 145 against Pakistan in January; they failed to make half of it. They are likely to have another tricky little chase against Sri Lanka today; if so, they will have to cope with the Sri Lanka spin attack of Herath, Randiv and Demons. </p><p>Sri Lanka will resume on 218 for six, a lead of 33. That score is slightly deceptive, however, because England's six wickets include two nightwatchmen. They still need to dismiss at least two of Angelo Mathews, Prasanna Jayawardene and Mahela Jayawardene, although they do have a newish ball to work with. You might as well set up camp behind the sofa. This could well be what Ashley Giles used to describe as an \"arse-nipper\".</p><!-- Block 2 --><p><strong>A quick recap of what this match means in terms of the ICC rankings</strong></p><p>• If England win, they stay No1 in the world</p><p>• If they draw, they drop below South Africa </p><p>• If they lose, they drop below South Africa and could be overtaken by Australia by the end of the month</p><!-- Block 3 --><p><strong>5.15am GMT / 12.15am ET</strong> \"I see you've got a big piece in the Times today,\" says Alex Davies. \"Playing away are we?\" </p><p>Oh, that's taken from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Wisden-Cricketers-Almanack-Lawrence-Booth/dp/1408156342/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333771671&amp;sr=8-1\">Lawrence Booth's Wisden Almanack</a>, which is available in all good bookshops from Wednesday. I suppose this is the bit where I should humblebrag along the lines of '1500 pages, all those amazing writers and they choose little ol' me for the first extract!', but London phonies have ruined self-deprecation so I'll keep the actual self-loathing for myself.</p><p>On a happier note, congratulations to our old friend Booth. Wisden Almanack editor! To me, he'll always be the man propping up the bar during a midweek fiasco in Leicester Square O'Neill's ...</p><!-- Block 4 --><p><strong>Anyone out there?</strong> Someone must be on the 274B bus home, or some such.</p><!-- Block 5 --><p><strong>92nd over: Sri Lanka 219-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 56, Mathews 3)</strong> Mathews is dropped in the first over of the day! He pushed a nasty delivery from Swann towards short leg, where Cook put down a sharp chance down by his left ankle. \"I'm on Moreton Island,\" says Charlie Clover, who already has one up on me, \"surrounded by genteel tattooed Queensland women and fat kids. Paradise. However I can't help but wonder if I'll be covered with XXXX (washed down with a knuckle sanga) if I go to the resort bar to ask them to turn off the NRL, and put on the England cricket. Thoughts?\" Do what needs to be done. Or, better still, get somebody else to do it for you.</p><!-- Block 6 --><p><strong>93rd over: Sri Lanka 221-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 3)</strong> It'll be the marvellous Jimmy Anderson at the other end. Can he produce one last new-ball burst to complete a brilliant personal winter? It's a good first over, in which Jayawardene touches two to fine leg. \"I'm here Rob, following the OBO in a dark hotel room in Siem Reap, Cambodia when I should be out looking at ancient temples or at least drinking local beer,\" says Joe Minihane.</p><!-- Block 7 --><p><strong>94th over: Sri Lanka 222-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 4)</strong> Jayawardene pads up to a big off break from Swann, bringing the inevitable LBW appeal, but there was far too much doubt for Bruce Oxenford to give that. Swann has started well; so has Jayawardene, whose defence looks airtight. \"I'm up and ready and have the fingernails ready,\" says Mona Stead. \"A lovely 20 degress in Melbourne.\"</p><!-- Block 8 --><p><strong>REVIEW! Sri Lanka 223-6 (Jayawardene not out 58)</strong> Jayawardene has been given out LBW! Asad Rauf took an <em>age</em> to give it. It was a magnificently theatrical appeal from Anderson, who was beseeching Asad Rauf to raise the finger. I thought Jayawardene was just outside the line, but it was very close. There might have been an inside edge as well. In fact, he definitely inside-edged it. The front-on replays aren't clear but you can see it from the camera behind the batsman. This will be overturned by Rod Tucker. Yes, <strong>Jayawardene survives</strong>, and both sides have one review remaining.</p><!-- Block 9 --><p><strong>95th over: Sri Lanka 223-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 5)</strong> Sri Lanka's lead is <strong>38</strong>. \"Ah Larry Booth,\" says Oliver Pattenden. \"Or 'Mr. Booth' as my ex-girlfriend from university used to call him. I'd be up writing a paper, OBO in the background, emailing in various quips or opinions, and she'd joke 'cheating on me with Mr. Booth again?'. And in the years after we graduated, I'd be occupied with a match, eschewing one of her family events. And, more sternly this time, she'd ask 'what do I say to my parents? You're busy with Mr. Booth?'. Of course time moved on. Booth left the Guardian. She and I broke up. Booth wrote for different papers. She and I dated new people. She no longer returns my emails. You never post mine. I guess that's the nature of change. There's no harm in nostalgia and regret, but that doesn't mean it doesn't still hurt.\"</p><p>That's beautifully sad. Sort of. It's like the bit in (500) Days of Summer where he makes the same joke at two different points in time, only the second time is when the relationship is crumbling, and she doesn't laugh. The breakdown of a relationship through the prism of Lawrence Booth. Who'd have thought?</p><!-- Block 10 --><p><strong>96th over: Sri Lanka 224-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 6)</strong> Jayawardene is beaten by a gorgeous delivery from Swann that skids straight on. Swann is bowling superbly here.</p><!-- Block 11 --><p><strong>97th over: Sri Lanka 225-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 58, Mathews 7)</strong> Mathews edges Anderson a fraction short of Swann at second slip. This has been a seriously purposeful start from England. They know how vital it is to take wickets while the ball is fairly new. Anderson is trying to unsettle Mathews with a few verbals.</p><p>\"Having just got back from Canada yesterday lunchtime I am now suffering from a severe bout of jet lag,\" says Ian Mell. \"This means I've been up most of the night working and I'm not sure I can cope with England chasing a sub -200 total today. If we all ask nicely do you think England can do the honourable thing and skittle Sri Lanka in the next half hour so that we may be able to chase 100 before lunchtime?\" Comfortable wins are for wimps. Make mine an arse-nipper.*<br /><em><br />* Guardian man reserves the right to amend this entry later in the day if England are 90 for eight chasing 101.</em></p><!-- Block 12 --><p><strong>98th over: Sri Lanka 227-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 59, Mathews 8)</strong> Mathews feels nervously at Swann, inside-edging onto the pad and not far wide of Cook at short leg. \"I am out here, Rob,\" says Ian Copestake, \"and I just want to say that I love you.\" No, Copestake, it's I just <em>called</em> to say I love you. You've ruined a potentially perfect moment with inadequate knowledge of Stevie Wonder song titles.</p><!-- Block 13 --><p><strong>99th over: Sri Lanka 232-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 60, Mathews 12)</strong> Mathews pulls Anderson superbly for  the first boundary of the day – and the first since the 77th over in fact. That's Anderson's fourth over of the morning. He probably has one more at most.</p><!-- Block 14 --><p><strong>100th over: Sri Lanka 233-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 61, Mathews 12)</strong> Mathews is dropped again by Cook at short leg! This was another sharp chance, low to his right when Mathews pushed at another good delivery from Swann. They are not easy in that position, although I reckon Ian Bell would have taken at least one of them. Swann is bowling a beautiful spell and beats Mathews on the outside two balls later. In other news, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/StuartBroad8/status/188365872623132672\">Stuart Broad is single</a>. An orderly one please, ladies, an orderly one.</p><!-- Block 15 --><p><strong>101st over: Sri Lanka 236-6 (trailed by 185 on first innings; M Jayawardene 62, Mathews 14)</strong> Tim Bresnan replaces Jimmy Anderson at the Janashakthi End. Three from the over, so Sri Lanka's lead is now 51. \"On a more prosaic note,\" begins Ian Copestake, \"I do think Oliver Pattenden has grounds for suing Booth for loss of booty.\"</p><!-- Block 16 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 238-7 (M Jayawardene c Cook b Swann 64)</strong> Graeme Swann has got Mahela Jayawardene with a beauty! That should be a matchwinning breakthrough. It was a horrible delivery that turned and bounced to hit the glove before deflecting onto the body and up in the air.  Cook, diving forward from short leg, took a comfortable catch. That was close to unplayable. It's the end of an immaculate defensive innings from Jayawardene – 64 from 191 balls with four fours – and Swann has yet another five-wicket haul.</p><!-- Block 17 --><p><strong>102nd over: Sri Lanka 238-7 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 14, P Jayawardene 0)</strong> \"Morning Smyth, morning everybody,\" says Josh Robinson. \"I'm here (for values of here that include Berlin). And have just about recovered from jet-lag. I've discovered that even if you can't get to sleep until 4 or 5, getting up to follow the Test is a good enough way of ensuring that after a few days you'll be so exhausted that you collapse in bed at about 9.30pm (much to the chagrin of your partner) and are back on a more or less normal rhythm shortly afterwards. More or less normal means that I'm sending relatively inane emails to you, of course. Flight back to Stansted tonight, and then Sawyer's joining me for a trip to Fenner's to watch the last day of the Lancashire game tomorrow. I suppose there are worse ways to spend the Easter weekend.\" Diane Sawyer?</p><!-- Block 18 --><p><strong>103rd over: Sri Lanka 240-7 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 16, P Jayawardene 0)</strong> \"I have an engineering entrance exam tomorrow but here I am sitting on my table constantly refreshing the OBO page instead of umm, lets say, solving Simple Harmonic motion problems,\" says Utkarsh Sharma. \"But I will tell you one thing, there is absolutely no need of chirping in a sentence like 'Anyone out there' in the updates. It makes me feel guilty of being the only one wasting time this way.\"</p><!-- Block 19 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 242-8 (P Jayawardene b Swann 2)</strong> Got him! Swann has picked up two Jayawardenes in as many overs. Prasanna Jayawardene had almost fallen twice earlier in the over when he missed a sweep shot and was bowled behind his legs. That's a dreadful stroke. Swann has six for 92; he should really end up with an eight-for here. He also has ten in the match for the second time in his Test career.</p><!-- Block 20 --><p><strong>104th over: Sri Lanka 242-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 16, Herath 0)</strong> England are into the tail now, with just Herath and Lakmal to come. Mathews should probably go into one-day mode and try to smack Sri Lanka towards a three-figure lead. Herath is beaten a beauty first ball.</p><!-- Block 21 --><p><strong>105th over: Sri Lanka 247-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 21, Herath 0)</strong> Mathews does go into one-day mode, slugging Bresnan to long on for four. He is an extremely dangerous hitter. \"Please can you politely tell all the people in hot sunny places to [rude word] off?\" says Robin Hazlehurst. \"It wasn't funny when an inch of snow fell last weekend, it was even less funny to get up this morning and find two more inches had fallen. The Estonian cricket season is unlikely to be starting at Easter this year. In other news, those who don't want an arse-nipper could consider that if Sri Lanka bat until teatime it probably won't be a close finish.\"</p><!-- Block 22 --><p><strong>106th over: Sri Lanka 248-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 22, Herath 0)</strong> Mathews is still taking singles when they are on offer, as he does in that over when he reverse sweeps Swann straight onto the shin of Anderson at slip. Had Anderson stood still he might have taken the catch, but he had moved to his right once he saw Mathews shaping to reverse sweep.</p><p>\"I'm currently in Manhattan, New York, following the OBO,\" says Zubair Shah. \"By coincidence I'm staying at my cousin's house, Zul Jamal, who is one of the investors in <a href=\"http://deathofagentlemanfilm.com/\">Death of a Gentleman</a>. I'm trying to find a single channel out of the 1024 on his TV that is showing the game. I've found a duck race, a 'how to loosen your bowels' infomercial and a 'god bless good hygiene' feature. Alas no Test match. You continue to be my only saviour.\" A saviour? Little ol' me?</p><!-- Block 23 --><p><strong>107th over: Sri Lanka 250-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 23, Herath 1)</strong> Tim Bresnan is replaced by Samit Patel. This is a decent move, as Mathews might find it harder to go after spin than seam. He drives a single to long on, and Herath mows another single into the leg side. Sri Lanka lead by <strong>65</strong>.</p><p>\"Hi there from Friday night in Quito,\" says Steve Bennett. \"Have just been to a 'British pub' (the Turtle's Head, hardy ha) which was showing nothing but rally and baseball, and serving a selection of British lagers including Heinekin and Miller draft. Forget finding a place to watch the cricket, does anyone know a place in Quito which sells decent beer? I'm in an Aussie-run backpacker hostel. An England win would go down nicely with breakfast tomorrow, thanks.\" I'll see what I can do.</p><!-- Block 24 --><p><strong>108th over: Sri Lanka 251-8 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 23, Herath 2)</strong> Herath is beaten by a jaffa from Swann. That was far too good for a No10. One from the over. \"I'm out here,\" says Mac Millings, \"if by 'here' you mean 'following England clumsily hide inevitable defeat behind the illusion of likely victory'. Also, I think the 102nd over's Josh Robinson is referring to Sawyer out of 'Lost' – a man so grubbily handsome that, just when it all finally seemed so clear, you'll question your orientation all over again. Either him or OBO regular Phil Sawyer, a man so grubbily etc and so forth.\"</p><!-- Block 25 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 251-9 (Herath c Anderson b Patel 2)</strong> Herath was never going to last long. He propped forward to a delivery from Patel that didn't turn as much as he expected and edged it straight to Anderson at slip.</p><!-- Block 26 --><p><strong>REVIEW! Sri Lanka 251-9 (Lakmal not out 0)</strong> England have used their last review. Lakmal got his bat jammed against his boot as he tried to play a very full delivery from Patel. The ball hit him on the toe and then looped up into the hands of Matt Prior. I don't think there was any bat involved; even if there was, the evidence is nowhere near conclusive enough. So Lakmal survives. Still, it was worth a try with only one wicket remaining. It maintains England's 100 per cent DRS record in this series: 10 reviews, none successful.</p><!-- Block 27 --><p><strong>109th over: Sri Lanka 251-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 23, Lakmal 0)</strong> Mathews must surely farm the strike now. \"My girlfriend, Shelagh, is preparing to open her new cafe in Shoreditch on Tuesday,\" says Mat Neale. \"Thanks to her I've been awake for the start of play for the last couple of days, so that's worth a shameless plug I feel.\" Sure, why not. <a href=\"http://www.salvationjanecafe.co.uk/\">Who fancies a little bit of Australia in Shoreditch</a>?</p><!-- Block 28 --><p><strong>110th over: Sri Lanka 252-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 24, Lakmal 0)</strong> Mathews declines a single from Swann's third delivery and then heaves a single to long on from the fifth.</p><!-- Block 29 --><p><strong>111th over: Sri Lanka 260-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 32, Lakmal 0)</strong> Mathews laps Patel for four and then crashes the last ball of the over through point for four. Sri Lanka lead by 75, but Swann now should have a full over at Lakmal. \"Do you also reserve the right to change the time?\" says John Starbuck. \"You should, as we are now in BST: GMT was overtaken some time ago but in your content early-rising condition you probably didn't notice.\"</p><!-- Block 30 --><p><strong>112th over: Sri Lanka 264-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 32, Lakmal 4)</strong> Lakmal inside edges Swann just short of Cook at short leg and then drives him through extra cover for four!</p><!-- Block 31 --><p><strong>113th over: Sri Lanka 265-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 33, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews keeps the strike with a single off the last ball of Patel's over. \"Adding to the weight of local non-exotic localizations, I'm up with my 18-month old daughter in a chilly Dorset, placating her with endless cheery technicolor productions on CBeebies that should really be barred from this unearthly hour and toasted fruit bread,\" says Richard Rowe. \"In return she's just about allowing me to follow the Test on the OBO. Any thoughts of sneakily switching on TMS are met with squealing demands to get 3rd And Bird back on the tellybox.\"</p><!-- Block 32 --><p><strong>114th over: Sri Lanka 270-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings;  Mathews 38, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews reverse sweeps Swann to third man for four and then takes a single from the fourth delivery. Lakmal survives the rest of the over.</p><!-- Block 33 --><p><strong>115th over: Sri Lanka 271-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Mathews 39, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews drives Patel's last ball for a single, and on we go with this mildly irritating last-wicket stand. Sri Lanka lead by 86. \"Following OBO in Nairobi instead of getting dressed to go a cousin's wedding,\" says Daudi Were. \"Would any of your readers know if we're meant to wear trousers under a Ugandan kanzu? The wife wants us in Ugandan high fashion today.\"</p><!-- Block 34 --><p><strong>116th over: Sri Lanka 272-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Mathews 40, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews take a single from Swann's fourth ball, and Lakmal does the necessary. He has looked comfortable, actually, for somebody who is supposed to be a rank tailender.</p><!-- Block 35 --><p><strong>117th over: Sri Lanka 277-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Mathews 45, Lakmal 4)</strong> Mathews blasts Patel for four and then, again, keeps the strike with a single off the last ball. \"Daudi Were?\" says Mike Selvey of the email in the 115th over. \"Is that the fellow who used to soar in the lineout for Scotland, and much loved of Bill McLaren?\"</p><!-- Block 36 --><p><strong>118th over: Sri Lanka 278-9 (trailed by 185 on first innings; Mathews 46, Lakmal 4)</strong> See 116th over.</p><!-- Block 37 --><p><strong>WICKET! Sri Lanka 278 all out (Mathews c Strauss b Finn 46)</strong> A good bowling change from Andrew Strauss ends a pesky last-wicket partnership. Mathews had become a bit too comfortable so Strauss went for a change of pace, bringing on Steven Finn for Samit Patel. Mathews, undone by a bit of uneven bounce, looped a short ball to Strauss, who took a good catch running back from midwicket. That's the end of the morning session, and it's been a job well done by England. After lunch they will need <strong>94</strong> to square the series and stay top of the ICC rankings. It should be a comfortable victory. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSRN8O4ULQs#t=10m27s\">Should</a>.</p><p>\"Suggest Daudi Were goes commando to the wedding,\" phwoars Robyn Adams. \"Should enliven the maiden aunts and possibly the bridesmaids – may even provoke enough of a row with the girlfriend for him to 'huff' off into the car and get the cricket on this radio.\"</p><!-- Block 38 --><p><strong>LUNCH</strong></p><!-- Block 39 --><p><strong>There have been two instances</strong> of a <a href=\"http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;innings_number=4;orderby=team_score;qualmax1=99;qualval1=target;result=2;template=results;type=team;view=innings\">team losing a Test when chasing a target of below 100</a>: England against Australia at The Oval in 1882 and Zimbabwe in Trinidad in 2000. Sri Lanka need early wickets to have any chance, and they will surely start with spin from both ends.</p><!-- Block 40 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 0-1 (Strauss b Dilshan 0)</strong> Andrew Strauss has gone in the first over! He felt down the wrong line at a delivery from the offspinner Tillakaratne Dilshan that turned to hit the off stump. It was an odd shot from Strauss, an absent-minded poke with a crooked bat and a slightly closed face.</p><!-- Block 41 --><p><strong>2nd over: England 4-1 (target: 94; Cook 3, Trott 1)</strong> It'll be spin from both ends, with Rangana Herath sharing the new ball. Cook forces three through the covers. England will be fine here; there's no need to do the whole despair thing. \"Being as I'm getting married to the beautiful Hayley Belle Furminger in a couple of hours, I feel rather chipper this fine morning,\" says Miles Geffin. \"That said, a cataclysmic batting collapse may well adversely impact on my mood. Is it terribly cowardly to pray for rain?\"</p><!-- Block 42 --><p><strong>3rd over: England 6-1 (target: 94; Cook 4, Trott 1)</strong> England are playing more positively than they did in that Abu Dhabi run-chase, when they stood passively while the soil fell over their head. Trott misses a pull at Dilshan and then flicks a single to midwicket. Cook pushes another single into the off side. \"Regardless of whether you publish this, please forward it to Daudi Were as a matter of urgency: yes, definitely trousers under a kanzu,\" says Josh Robinson. \"These things are sufficiently translucent that not wearing them will be a considerable social faux pas. If you weren't already posting on the OBO I'd also suggest that it would injure your dignity.\"</p><!-- Block 43 --><p><strong>REVIEW! England 8-1 (Trott not out 2)</strong> Trott survives a huge shout for LBW from Herath, and Sri Lanka are going to review the decision. He played around his pad at a fullish delivery; I don't think it straightened enough to  hit the stumps. Hawkeye shows it was indeed missing leg stump, so Trott continues.</p><!-- Block 44 --><p><strong>4th over: England 9-1 (target: 94; Cook 6, Trott 2)</strong> \"I'm following the action from the beach in Peru, explaining the delights of five day cricket to a Dutchman,\" says Chris Hodgson. \"I'm also the manager of the Peruvian national cricket team – any chance of a shout out to the Llamas?\" Damn straight. Go follow them on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/CricketPeru\">that Twitter thing</a>.\"</p><!-- Block 45 --><p><strong>5th over: England 11-1 (target: 94; Cook 7, Trott 3)</strong> Two from Dilshan's over. The ball isn't misbehaving too much; just a little uneven bounce and the odd bit of sharp spin. \"I'm following the OBO from Kigali, which is a little like Slough, in case anyone was thinking of visiting,\" touristboards Will Rollason. \"In response to Daudi Were (over 115), and as a professional anthropologist, I can confidently say that in questions of other peoples' traditional costume: trousers, always trousers.\"</p><!-- Block 46 --><p><strong>6th over: England 13-1 (target: 94; Cook 8, Trott 4)</strong> Trott inside edges a quicker one from Herath onto the pad. Run-scoring will not be easy unless KP goes mad again but England are going about this in the right way, looking for singles whenever possible.</p><!-- Block 47 --><p><strong>7th over: England 22-1 (target: 94; Cook 17, Trott 4)</strong> A good over for England begins when Cook smashes Dilshan straight down the ground for four, an effective agricultural blow. The next ball is a peach that turns sharply to take a thick edge. The ball after that is too short and cut decisively for four more.</p><!-- Block 48 --><p><strong>8th over: England 27-1 (target: 94; Cook 22, Trott 4)</strong> Four more to Cook, slammed through the covers when Herath drops one short and wide. He has raced to 21 from 31 balls. \"How jaded by his own success is Chris Hodgson (4th over)?\" says Matt Dony. \"He emails in to say he's on a beach, and then as an afterthought mentions that he just happens to be manager of an international sports team?\"</p><!-- Block 49 --><p><strong>9th over: England 31-1 (target: 94; Cook 25, Trott 5)</strong> Cook pats Dilshan into the leg side for two and is then beaten by a beauty from Dilshan. Asad Rauf goes to the third umpire to check the stumping, just in case, but Cook was fine. </p><p>\"If it helps Robin Hazelhurst feel any worse, it's also warm and sunny in Saigon,\" says Dan Hatfield. \"Not as warm and sunny as Colombo though – I got back from there yesterday. Highlights of the trip include watching KP make his 151 and my insane Irish friend essentially molesting Ian Botham in the hotel bar.\"</p><!-- Block 50 --><p><strong>WICKET! England 31-2 (Trott LBW b Herath 5)</strong> That's not a bad shout for LBW, you know. Trott pushed forward at Herath, bat and pad very close together, and the ball hit him on the front pad around the line of off stump. There was a fairly muted shout for LBW from Sri Lanka. Asad Rauf said not out but Jayawardene, almost as an afterthought, decided to risk the last review. This will be close. He was a long way forward but bounce is rarely an issue with Herath. Did Trott get outside the line? He's out! It was in line and hitting middle and leg halfway up. Is that one last DRS wicket for the plane or the start of a tragifarcical collapse?</p><!-- Block 51 --><p><strong>10th over: England 34-2 (target: 94; Cook 26, Pietersen 2)</strong> Pietersen comes down the track to his first ball, driving it to mid on for a single. \"Congratulations to Miles and the soon to be (please please please) Mrs Hayley Belle Furminger-Geffen,\" says Niall Mullen. I don't get the joke. It's not rude is it? <em>Is something brilliant happening?</em></p><!-- Block 52 --><p><strong>11th over: England 39-2 (target: 94; Cook 30, Pietersen 3)</strong> It's friends reunited, with Dilshan bowling to Pietersen. He sweeps a single and then Cook cuts crisply for four. He is playing very nicely.</p><!-- Block 53 --><p><strong>12th over: England 44-2 (target: 94; Cook 33, Pietersen 5)</strong> Four from Herath's over. England are cruising. Put the Starship song on. \"Alas that is very rude,\" says Ian Copestake. \"In German Hayley Belle Furminger-Geffen euphemistically translated means, England are going to flaming well ballls this up.\"</p><!-- Block 54 --><p><strong>13th over: England 46-2 (target: 94; Cook 34, Pietersen 6)</strong> Suraj Randiv is coming on in place of Tillakaratne Dilshan. This will be interesting, because he was savaged by Pietersen in the first innings, who hit him for 39 from 17 deliveries. Here he settles for a single through point.</p><!-- Block 55 --><p><strong>14th over: England 47-2 (target: 94; Cook 35, Pietersen 6)</strong> Cook, trying to cut, is beaten thrice by quicker balls from Herath. That was beautifully bowled. \"What are the chances of the weather saving England?\" says Robin Hazlehurst? \"Any sign of rain around there? Or snow? They can have some of ours, we've got loads of the [rude word] stuff to spare. In April. At Easter. Hayley Belle Furminger-Geffen doesn't even come close to describing it.\" Apparently they did have the covers ready earlier, but it all looks fine from my King's Cross vantage point.</p><!-- Block 56 --><p><strong>15th over: England 53-2 (target: 94; Cook 41, Pietersen 6)</strong> A fine stroke from Cook, who drills Randiv through extra cover for four to take England past 50. Nothing can go wrong for England here, and I'm not just saying that so as to tempt fate because I'm a tension junkie.</p><p>\"I'm following this from a beach in Bali where I'm married to the president's daughter and captain the international swingball team,\" says Peter Harmer. \"Fine, that's a lie. I'm following from a mattress on the floor of a small flat in N London. I'm sorry, I just felt so inadequate.\" </p><p>What's the most Mittyish thing any of you have done? Come on, out with it. I think I tried to impress a girl once by telling her I'd spoken to Lauren Laverne after a gig. Not made out with her or anything jazzy; <em>spoken</em> to her. Talk about aiming high.</p><!-- Block 57 --><p><strong>16th over: England 63-2 (target: 94; Cook 41, Pietersen 16)</strong> Effortless brutality from Pietersen, who gives Herath the charge and drives him down the ground for a wonderful flat six. That's Pietersen's seventh six of the match, a new record for this fixture. The next ball is blitzed emphatically over mid off for four more.</p><p>\"It's my 15th wedding anniversary today,\" says Simon McMahon. \"1997, England had just returned from New Zealand and an Ashes summer was about to begin. 600 Tests later, however, and despite my best efforts, Mrs McMahon (and now two daughters, Evie and Anna) have not the slightest interest in this wonderful game. Maybe  a mention in the OBO will change their mind? And make up for the fact that I forgot to buy a present (15 is crystal, apparently).\" You could always buy her Lawrence Booth's Wisden Almanack 2012 as a belated present. I hear the statistical analysis of the first 2000 Tests is to <em>die</em> for.</p><!-- Block 58 --><p><strong>17th over: England 71-2 (target: 94; Cook 42, Pietersen 22)</strong> Pietersen switch hits Randiv to third man for four. All above board this time, as he did not switch his hands until Randiv was into his delivery stride. Pietersen has 22 from 19 balls; he is batting like a lord.</p><p>\"Talk of Doddie Weir, however tangentially, always reminds me of the peerless Bill McLaren's description of him as 'on the charge like a mad giraffe',\" says Stephen Davenport. \"Which is perhaps only surpassed by Simon Geoghegan's appearance at the ruck: 'all arms and legs like a mad octopus'. Cricket commentary could do with a few more zoological similes, don't you think?\" Definitely. Sky had Freddie Flintoff commentating on the Darts in 2010; they should return the favour and get Sid Waddell in for a county game.</p><!-- Block 59 --><p><strong>18th over: England 76-2 (target: 94; Cook 46, Pietersen 23)</strong> Dilshan replaces Herath and is cut for four by Cook. \"There was a long queue in the nightclub cloakrooms once, so me and two other chaps kept our coats on in the meantime,\" says Robin Hazlehurst. \"A charming and very attractive young lady came over to us and asked why we had leather jackets on, so I obviously replied that it was because we were members of the Russian mafia. When she looked nonplussed I pulled out a Russian visa from my pocket and told her it was my mafia ID. She walked off looking more pitying than impressed. Apparently Russian mafioso is not a very good thing to claim to be if you want to wow the ladies.\" Do you have a cut-glass accent? Maybe that gave the game away.</p><!-- Block 60 --><p><strong>19th over: England 81-2 (target: 94; Cook 49, Pietersen 26)</strong> Herath has changed ends. That probably means the end of a disappointing match for Randiv, who took just one wicket for 123. Cook repels a spitting delivery and then sweeps over the top for a couple. \"It's my 20th anniversary,\" says David Toze. \"As a failsafe, I bought myself a copy of \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Cricket-Golden-Extraordinary-Images-1859/dp/184403237X\">Cricket the Golden Age</a>\" by Duncan Steer, since no one else was going to buy it for me. If anyone out there is interested as to why famous fast bowling metrosexual Bob Willis says \"the luncheon interval\" the answer is on P236…\" I'm confused. It's <em>your</em> 20th? And you bought a present for yourself? Does that mean you're married to you?</p><!-- Block 61 --><p><strong>19.4 overs: England 97-2. ENGLAND WIN BY EIGHT WICKETS (Cook 49, Pietersen 42)</strong> Pietersen ends the match in a hurry, larruping his BFF Dilshan for 16 from four consecutive deliveries, the last of those a lofted six over midwicket. He ends with 42 from 28 balls and 193 from 193 balls in the match. That's an astonishing performance on an awkward pitch, and he and Graeme Swann will now have a zesty, borderline-homoerotic arm-wrestle for the Man of the Match award. More importantly, England have won the match, drawn the series and ensured they will be No1 in the Test rankings when they play the West Indies next month.</p><p>That's an excellent victory for England, a happy ending to a difficult few months.

I fear I am being unfair in focusing my anger on this man. I feel no emotion for the girlfriend; I would not wish her to remain childless. But I&nbsp;dread him having a baby, especially at this time in my life. </strong></p><p><strong>This feeling is magnified when I think that, in the last five years, we have ended up having to rescue three of his pets. I don't anticipate having to&nbsp;do the same with a baby, really, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;am so bitter and angry that I am trying to avoid them, as the thought of&nbsp;his happiness makes me want to hurt him. What can I do? <em>L</em></strong></p><p></p><p>I would be amazed if, after what you have been through, you weren't angry, bitter and feeling that life was unfair. You need to allow yourself to have these feelings: they are valid. It is OK to rant against the world. But some of your feelings are tipping over into something else, and to be able to move on, you need to address where the wound lies.</p><p>I contacted <a href=\"http://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Philippa Whittick, a systemic family psychotherapist</a>. She wondered what the friend represents: \"Who is he in your transference? Who does he represent? Why do you identify with him and not the girlfriend?\"</p><p>Because while it is perfectly understandable for you to feel angry, when one person triggers the depth of feeling he does, there is usually something else going on too.</p><p>It could be that to rant against the world, at this unfairness, is too abstract for you, you may need a \"target\" and it may be easier – less damaging – to have this friend as the bullseye than, say, your husband. I am not saying you  <em>should</em> also be angry at your husband, but I wondered if you <em>might</em> be.</p><p>Have you told your husband how you&nbsp;feel? I can't help thinking that you&nbsp;haven't. I&nbsp;wonder why your husband feels he keeps having to bail out this friend.</p><p>Whittick thought it would be really helpful for you both to see a therapist together to \"explore what it's like for them to be a couple who want a child and can't have one. What nerve has this man and his girlfriend hit? What's stopping you from saying: 'What a great opportunity for them, this might be the making of them?'\" She also thought it would be a good opportunity for you to talk about the \"triangular\" friendship you and your husband have with this friend.</p><p>Sometimes, when one can't have a&nbsp;child, various other people may become pregnant and it does not trigger anything, but then, one particular couple has a baby and suddenly, all those emotions come flooding out.</p><p>Do you feel as if they are having your baby – the baby you should have had? Do you&nbsp;worry about your husband potentially having to be, as Whittick put it, \"parental with someone else's child\" – viz the idea that you may be left looking after, in some way, this couple's baby?</p><h2>Your problems solved</h2><p></p><p>Contact Annalisa Barbieri, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU or email <a href=\"mailto:annalisa.barbieri@mac.com\" title=\"\">annalisa.barbieri@mac.com</a>.
